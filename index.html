            <div class="text">
              <p>
                The idea is simple: you input a rough concept, and the tool
                generates branching narrative paths visualized as a graph. You
                can sculpt those branches into a structured screenplay format
                and export to Fountain for use in professional screenwriting
                software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most AI writing tools are trained on generic internet text,
                which is why they output generic results. I wanted something
                that understood actual cinematic storytelling—not plot summaries
                or Wikipedia synopses, but the actual structural DNA of films.
                So I spent a month curating 100 films I consider high-quality
                cinema. Not just popular films, but works with distinctive
                narrative structures: Godard's jump cuts and essay-film
                digressions, Kurosawa's parallel character arcs, Brakhage's
                non-linear visual poetry, Tarkovsky's slow-burn temporal
                structures. The selection was deliberately eclectic because I
                wanted the model to learn that "story" can mean many things.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting useful training data from films is harder than it
                sounds. I built a 1000+ line Python pipeline using Qwen3-VL to
                analyze each film with subtitles enabled. The pipeline extracts
                scene-level narrative beats, character relationships and how
                they evolve, thematic threads, and dialogue patterns. The tricky
                part was getting Qwen3-VL to understand cinematic structure
                rather than just summarizing plot. I had to iterate on the
                prompts extensively to get it to identify things like "this
                scene functions as a mirror to the opening" or "this character's
                arc inverts the protagonist's." That took weeks and I'm still
                not fully satisfied with it, but it's good enough to produce
                useful training data.
              </p>
              <p>
                From those extractions I generated a 10K example dataset of
                prompt-to-branching-narrative pairs, then fine-tuned
                Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with a LoRA optimized for probabilistic
                story branching. The LoRA handles the graph generation—exploring
                possible narrative directions—while the full 7B model generates
                the actual technical screenplay format when you export. I chose
                the 7B model because I wanted something that could run
                affordably at scale while still being capable enough for nuanced
                generation. The whole thing is served on a single 4090 GPU using
                vLLM. The frontend uses React Flow for the graph visualization.
                The key insight was that screenwriting is fundamentally about
                making choices—what if the character goes left instead of
                right?—but most writing tools force you into a linear document
                too early. The graph structure lets you explore multiple paths
                before committing, which matches how writers actually think in
                early development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest surprise was how much the film selection mattered.
                Early versions trained on more mainstream films produced much
                more formulaic outputs. Adding experimental and international
                cinema dramatically improved the variety and interestingness of
                the generations. The model seemed to learn that narrative
                structure is a design space, not a formula.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've been using it ourselves to break through second-act
                problems—when you know where you want to end up but can't figure
                out how to get there. The branching format forces you to think
                in possibilities rather than committing too early.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can try it at
                <a href="https://cinegraphs.ai/">https://cinegraphs.ai/</a> — no
                signup required to test it out. You get a full project with up
                to 50 branches without registering, though you'll need to create
                an account to save it. Registered users get 3 free projects. I'd
                love feedback on whether the generation quality feels
                meaningfully different from generic AI tools, and whether the
                graph interface adds value or just friction.

                Why didn't I open source it in the first place? Linux has been
                by primary driver for more than a decade. I genuinely believe in
                the philosophy, and have always wanted to give back to the
                community. The primary reason, probably, was because I was
                ashamed that I had 90% vibe-coded the app. More than 2 decades
                of writing software, and my first contribution to FOSS would be
                AI-generated code? Would it withstand even the most minimal of
                scrutiny? Would by (unknown) name forever be tarnished? I
                exaggerate, but only slightly :)
              </p>
              <p>
                So, yesterday, after a fair bit of trepidation, I changed the
                github repo visibility to public and put up a announcement on
                the app's website [1]. I have also submitted the app to F-Droid
                [2]. As before, I welcome the community's feedback and
                suggestions!

                It compiles to a single ~27MB binary — no Node.js, Docker, or
                Python required.
              </p>
              <p>Key features:</p>
              <p>
                - Persistent memory via markdown files (MEMORY, HEARTBEAT, SOUL
                markdown files) — compatible with OpenClaw's format - Full-text
                search (SQLite FTS5) + semantic search (local embeddings, no API
                key needed) - Autonomous heartbeat runner that checks tasks on a
                configurable interval - CLI + web interface + desktop GUI -
                Multi-provider: Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama etc - Apache 2.0
              </p>
              <p>Install: `cargo install localgpt`</p>
              <p>
                I use it daily as a knowledge accumulator, research assistant,
                and autonomous task runner for my side projects. The memory
                compounds — every session makes the next one better.
