              <a href="https://release.ai/">https://release.ai/</a>). We
              launched on HN in 2020 (<a
                href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22486031"
                >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22486031</a
              >) after leaving TrueCar, where we managed a 300 person
              development team. Our original focus was making staging
              environments easier with ephemeral environments, but along the way
              AI applications started to emerge as an important and critical
              component of distributed applications. As we talked to customers
              using our original product, we realized we had built the
              underlying platform needed to address the needs of orchestrating
              AI applications and infrastructure. So here we are and we’re
              excited to share Release.ai with HN.
              <p>
                Here’s a video showcasing the platform and demonstrating how to
                easily manage new data and changes using the RAG stack of your
                choice:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OdWRxMX1iA"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OdWRxMX1iA</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to try release.ai out, we’re offering a sandbox
                account with limited free GPU cycles so you can play around and
                get a feel for Release.ai:
                <a href="https://release.ai">https://release.ai</a>. We suggest
                playing around with some of the RAG AI templates and adding
                custom workflows like in the demo video. The sandbox comes with
                5 free compute hours on an Amazon g5.2xlarge instance (A10 with
                24GB VRAM, 8vCPUs and 32GB). You will also get 16 GB and 4vCPUs
                for cpu workloads such as web servers. You will be able to run
                an inference engine plus things like an api server, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the sandbox expires, you can switch to our free plan,
                which requires a credit card and associating an AWS/GCP account
                with Release to manage the compute in your cloud account. The
                free account provides 100 free managed environment hours a
                month. If you never go over, you never pay us anything. If you
                do, our pricing is here:

              </p>
              <p>
                For those that like to read more, here’s the deeper background.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s clear that open source AI and AI privacy are going to be
                big. Yes, many developers are going to choose SaaS offerings
                like OpenAI to build their AI applications, but as open source
                frameworks and models improve, we’re seeing a shift to open
                source running on cloud. Security and privacy is a top concern
                of companies leveraging these SaaS solutions, which forces them
                to look at running infrastructure themselves. That’s where we
                hope to come in: we’ve built Release.ai so all your data, models
                and infrastructure stay in your cloud account and open source
                frameworks are first class citizens.
              </p>
              <p>
                Orchestration - Integrating AI applications into a software
                development workflow and orchestrating their lifecycle is a new
                and different challenge than traditional web application
                development. Release also makes it possible to manage and
                integrate your web and AI apps using a single application and
                methodology.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make orchestrating AI applications easier, we built a
                workflow engine that can create the complex workflows that AI
                applications require. For example, you can automate the
                redeployment of an AI inference server easily when underlying
                data changes using webhooks and our workflow engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cost and expertise - Managing and scaling the hardware required
                to run AI workloads is hard and can be incredibly expensive.
                Release.ai lets you manage GPU compute resources across multiple
                clouds with different instance/node groups for various jobs
                within a single admin interface. We use K8s under the covers to
                pull this off. With over 5 years of building and running K8s
                infrastructure our customers have told us this is how it should
                be done.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting started with AI frameworks is time consuming and
                requires some pretty in-depth expertise. We built out a library
                of AI templates (<a
                  href="https://docs.release.com/release.ai/release.ai-templates"
                  >https://docs.release.com/release.ai/release.ai-templates</a
                >) using our Application Template format (which is kind of a
                super docker-compose:
                <a
                  href="https://docs.release.com/reference-documentation/application-settings/application-template"
                  >https://docs.release.com/reference-documentation/application...</a
                >) for common open source frameworks to make it easy to get
                started developing AI applications. Setting up and getting these
                frameworks running is a hassle, so we made it one click to
                launch and deploy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We currently have over 20 templates including temples for RAG
                applications, fine tuning and useful tools like Juypter
                notebooks, Promptfoo, etc. We worked closely with Docker and
                Nvidia to support their frameworks: GenAI and Nvidia NEMO/Nims.
                We plan to launch community templates soon after launch. If you
                have suggestions for more templates we should support, please
                let us know in the comments.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re thrilled to share Release.ai with you and would love to
                get your feedback. We hope you’ll try it out, and please let us
                know what you think!

              <a href="https://www.firezone.dev">https://www.firezone.dev</a>),
              a remote access platform that is a replacement for legacy
              corporate VPNs. Built on WireGuard (a fast, modern VPN protocol),
              Firezone secures your team’s apps, networks and services using
              access policies synced with your identity provider. You deploy
              tiny, self-contained binaries into your infrastructure anywhere
              you need access, and your workforce uses our client apps to reach
              the resources they protect.
              <p>
                Here’s a demo:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/QEv7dJwKMvo"
                  >https://youtu.be/QEv7dJwKMvo</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Historically, the tool used to achieve this has been the
                corporate VPN. These work off a security model where you
                authenticate with the perimeter and gain access to the network
                behind it, which works when most workers are in office and
                resources on-prem. But as workers go remote and resources move
                to the cloud, the perimeter blurs, making it harder to secure.
              </p>
              <p>
                I experienced this issue first-hand as a security engineer
                hunting for APT malware on Cisco's intranet. Malware often
                landed first on remote employee laptops, then spread from there
                to critical internal systems. Firewalls were somewhat effective
                at solving this problem, but they were clunky—it could take
                months for Infosec to approve requests to allow your team’s app
                or services through.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Covid forced everyone to work from home, even Cisco
                struggled to grapple with the increased demand on its VPN
                concentrators. The perimeter defense model meant that we had to
                VPN into the intranet to get anything done, and if the speeds
                were really bad, we couldn't work that day.
              </p>
              <p>
                One way to solve the above problems is to break up the single
                perimeter into many smaller ones, shifting them closer to the
                resources they protect. That way, compromising one perimeter
                does not gain you access to all others, and traffic is not
                bottlenecked through a single choke point. However, now you have
                many VPN tunnels instead of one, and most VPN protocols are too
                heavyweight for this.
              </p>
              <p>
                If <i>Cisco</i> was facing these issues with remote access, I
                thought, others <i>must</i> be facing similar problems. So when
                WireGuard came along, I started Firezone.
              </p>
              <p>
                WireGuard tunnels are so lightweight you can open thousands of
                them from an iPhone to whatever resources you need access to.
                Firezone builds on that and also handles NAT traversal, so you
                don’t need to change your firewall configuration to use it. Just
                deploy Gateways - small, statically-linked Linux binaries -
                where you need access, and Firezone’s homegrown STUN/TURN layer
                (we call “snownet”) handles the rest. If you need more
                throughput, just deploy more Gateways, and load is balanced
                across all of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                WireGuard keys are distributed to peers only when access to a
                particular resource is authorized, and private keys never leave
                the device’s memory where they were generated. If a Gateway goes
                offline, Firezone will migrate connections from it to healthy
                ones within about 10 seconds, without user intervention. We lean
                heavily on Elixir/Phoenix and OTP’s awesome concurrency features
                to power all of this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Firezone’s access control system is intentionally very simple.
                Policies define which user groups have access to which resources
                based on a default-deny system. More perimeters means more rules
                managing access to them, so we intentionally wanted to keep
                admins out of “ACL hell” as the number of controls grew.
              </p>
              <p>
                One area we’re actively working to improve is our UI/UX -
                Firezone is a product built by engineers, for engineers, and at
                times, it shows! Expect refinements to come in this area over
                the coming months.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d love for you to give Firezone a try! You can spin up a demo

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I tired of sharing screen via Google Meet with 1-hour
                limitation, with Zoom and 40-minute limitation, etc. With paid
                Slack subscription. And often times I just needed to screenshare
                with no audio.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I ended up with my own solution - no registration, low
                memory, low CPU, low tek 1 fps encrypted screen sharing.
                Currently sharing only the main screen (good for laptop users).
              </p>
              <p>
                It's very raw in terms of infrastructure, since I'm not counting
                bytes (yikes!), everything works on my own dedicated server. But
                the service itself has been tested, we've been sharing screens
                for countless hours. All sessions last for 48 hours, then it
                gets removed with all remaining info.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every new frame replaces the other, and everything is end-to-end
                encrypted so even server owners and operators won't be able to
                see what are you sharing.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also no tracking, except the main page - and I use my
                own analytics. Sessions are not getting tracked and never will
                be, and observability currently is not in place.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again, this is a true one-person side hacking project I hope
                (but I have serious doubts) I might need to scale if it's
                getting traction to support more users.
