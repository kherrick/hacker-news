            <div class="text">
              <p>
                #1: While working as a web designer, I would often spend
                significant time going back and forth with my clients over
                external tooling (e.g. creating new email accounts, recovering
                lost Google Analytics passwords, etc), so I started searching
                for an integrated platform. The best solution at the moment was
                a product called GoodBarry / Business Catalyst, which no longer
                exists (it was acquired by Adobe and then shutdown). I wanted to
                try building my own platform, making these tools easily
                accessible from a central administration panel, like cPanel, but
                without the extra tooling that would confuse non-tech savvy
                users.
              </p>
              <p>
                #2: None of the website builders at the time met my expectations
                in terms of design quality and code flexibility. This is no
                longer the case, as WebFlow has done a great job in creating a
                high quality website builder. However, once again I wanted to
                try building this for myself. After a few iterations, I
                developed a WYSIWYG editor that edits directly on existing HTML
                tags by using the style attribute, without adding class/code
                overhead, so that the HTML remains readable and can be easily
                expanded upon. There's definitely room for improvement on the
                building end, but for now, users can choose from 38 different
                templates, or they can upload their own website via the Files
                module, which should be compatible with the website editor as
                long as its not JavaScript dependent (e.g. uses frameworks).
              </p>
              <p>
                It's true that there is an abundance of similar platforms, the
                most popular one being HubSpot. However, I find most of these
                platforms to be bloated with features to the detriment of the
                UI/UX. With SiteOS, I wanted to build an intuitive platform,
                streamlined for website administration. The CRM automatically
                generates leads from website form submissions and email
                communications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because I believe I created a developer-centric product, I
                decided to make it open source. The GitHub repo is available at:
                <a href="https://github.com/renatodc/SiteOS"

                Something I'm grateful for is that our community here on HN is
                the difference between PL existing and not. There was actually a
                time early on when I was one day away from halting work on it. I
                posted here on a whim, and was shocked to receive some really
                constructive and energizing feedback that went on to power my
                indie dev journey over the past two and a half years.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a quick recap, the story started when I dove head-first down
                the financial independence rabbit hole. I wanted a hands-on and
                visual way to explore the trade-offs between different life
                paths. One thing led to another, and I decided to build
                ProjectionLab.

                After last year's Show HN, I really put my nose to the
                grindstone, and here are some of the big developments:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Self-hosting for Lifetime users (spin up your own private
                deployment, based on Docker Compose, includes support for
                auth/encryption)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Cash-flow visualization for each simulated year (sankey
                charts)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Tax analytics (detailed breakdowns for projected income,
                taxes, marginal rates, effective brackets, etc)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Major redesign of entire app, with landing page and resources
                now split into separate project
              </p>
              <p>
                - Filing separately option to improve support for international
                locations that don't have joint filing
              </p>
              <p>- Roth Conversions and 72t (SEPP) distribution modeling</p>
              <p>
                - Improvements to US tax estimation (Secure 2.0 updates, rental
                property tax deductions, Medicare + IRMAA, NIIT, principal
                residence exclusion, etc)
              </p>
              <p>- Better support for planning as a couple</p>
              <p>
                - More modeling options for cash-flow priorities to support
                different budgeting philosophies and goals
              </p>
              <p>
                - Extra liquidity + withdrawal options, ability to fund expenses
                with specific accounts or route income to specific accounts
              </p>
              <p>
                - Customization options for Monte Carlo simulations
                (characterization of success rates and outcome types, option to
                set random seed, etc)
              </p>
              <p>
                - And a whole bunch more! (<a

                The HN community has had a huge role in shaping my overall
                direction with PL, and I can't wait to hear what you all think
                of the updates and where you would like to see things go from
                here.
              </p>
              <p>
                As always, PL is free to try, with no need to create an account.
                It does not ask to link your financial accounts, and it has a
                sandbox mode if you just want to hop in and see how it works.

              <a href="https://www.artie.so/">https://www.artie.so/</a>). We
              solve the problem of stale production data in the data warehouse.
              We’re open source, and you can try it for free here:
              <a href="https://github.com/artie-labs/transfer"
                >https://github.com/artie-labs/transfer</a
              >.
              <p>
                Specifically, we do real time data replication from databases to
                data warehouses. We leverage change data capture (CDC) and
                stream processing to perform data transfers efficiently,
                enabling sub-minute latency and significant cost savings. Here’s
                a quick demo (jumping straight to the important part):
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAi1tm4gd9U#t=81s"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAi1tm4gd9U#t=81s</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                I encountered this problem when I was a heavy data warehouse
                user at prior jobs. The data in our data warehouse was super
                lagged and analytics were always stale. Imagine a fintech
                company performing anti-fraud/transaction monitoring with
                batched ETLs and finding out that fraudulent transactions
                occurred 24 hours ago. This was very frustrating to me! Since my
                background was in distributed systems and database architecture,
                I knew that there was a better way to perform data transfers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The more teams I spoke with, the more I realized this was a real
                pain point. People wanted real time data for analytics, fraud
                alerting, transaction monitoring, and training AI/ML models; but
                there wasn’t an easy out-of-the-box solution. Companies were
                either constrained on latency or schema integrity/data usability
                or data accuracy. Companies started telling me that if I built a
                tool that is robust, near real time, but also maintained schema
                integrity and data accuracy, they would very happily pay for it.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I built Artie, a real time, open-source data streaming
                solution to transfer data from databases to data warehouses and
                handle schemas automatically in-flight (DMLs and DDLs).
              </p>
              <p>
                Typical ETL solutions leverage batched processes that run on a
                schedule (DAGs, Airflow), which cannot achieve real time data
                syncs. This means that when companies aggregate production data
                into their data warehouse, the underlying data is always stale.
              </p>
              <p>
                Streaming change data capture (CDC) logs is a more efficient way
                to transfer data, and helps lower networking/data ingestion
                costs as well. However, building data pipelines with CDC
                streaming is complicated. I wanted Artie to be the tool that
                abstracts away that complexity so that any company can benefit
                from having real time data.
              </p>
              <p>
                A big challenge is implementing CDC streaming for stateful data
                (i.e. row updates/deletes) and schema changes (DDLs), which most
                streaming solutions just don’t address, meaning that complexity
                is passed down to the customer. A lot of in-house streaming
                solutions leverage some combination of Debezium + Kafka/Kinesis
                + Apache Flink and are able to achieve near real time syncs, but
                they only handle append-only events (inserts) and don't handle
                schema changes/schema evolution like DMLs and DDLs. Not handling
                thse means the data at the destination doesn't look exactly like
                the production database, which obscures the source of truth. You
                end up having to do additional work to make the data warehouse
                tables match the source DB.
              </p>
              <p>
                So how do we offer a robust CDC streaming solution? We grab CDC
                logs using Debezium and/or our custom connector (which solves
                for certain edge cases that Debezium doesn’t handle) and push
                them into Kafka (or Google Pub/Sub). Kafka helps ensure ordering
                and ease of recovery upon an outage - we use one table per
                topic, and the partition key is the primary key(s) to ensure no
                out of order writes. Artie then consumes these events from Kafka
                and we have an in-memory DB with our typing library that can
                infer schemas (DML and DDL), performs optimizations like
                deduplications, and then flushes data to the data warehouse.
                When the data warehouse confirms a successful merge, we then
                commit the offset within Kafka. This all happens with sub-minute
                data latency even at high volumes (several TBs or billions of
                rows).
              </p>
              <p>
                However the data looks in your database, it should look exactly
                the same in your data warehouse. We also strive to handle all
                data types with no exceptions - i.e. supporting TOAST columns,
                composite keys as primary keys, arrays, large rows (&gt;1MBs),
                etc. (I say “strive” because I’m sure we haven’t seen all
                possible data types yet!).
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve been live for a while now. Several companies use us to
                update all their analytic dashboards in real time (with
                dashboards built on top of their data warehouse). Fintech
                platforms use us to perform financial transaction monitoring. A
                utilities software platform uses us to grab video/photo data to
                perform risk/hazard assessment against ML models.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artie is live and supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB sources
                and Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift destinations. We make money
                from our hosted service. We charge based on usage (# of rows
                transferred per month, not including initial snapshots).
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love for you to try it out! You can get started with the
                open source version here:
                <a href="https://github.com/artie-labs/transfer"
                  >https://github.com/artie-labs/transfer</a
                >. We have a small OSS Slack community (www.artie.so/slack) –
                feel free to ping us for help or any other requests.
              </p>
              <p>
                For our hosted version, we need to ensure that we have enough
                storage and compute capacity provisioned, so we’re asking cloud
                users to hop on a quick call with us before we activate your
                account. Eventually we’ll have easy self-serve functionality but
                that’s not 100% built yet, so for now we set up a Slack channel
                to ensure smooth deployments. If you’re willing to work with us
                on that, we’ll be super excited to show you what we’ve got. Just
                email us at founders@artie.so or request access from
                <a href="https://www.artie.so">https://www.artie.so</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love for you to try the OSS or hosted solution and give us
                feedback! We’re eager to improve the product and test it against
                various workloads and data types :)
