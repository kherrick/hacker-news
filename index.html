              <a href="https://roame.travel">https://roame.travel</a>). Roame is
              a flight search engine that lets you find and redeem business
              class flights using points and miles, rather than exorbitant
              amounts of cash. Here's a demo video:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fixXuyhofgo"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fixXuyhofgo</a
              >
              We have been flying around the world in first and business class
              using points for years—Tim for more than a decade and Zi more
              recently. A little over a year ago, we were trying to find cheap
              round-trip tickets in first or business class to Asia and back
              using points. We had tons of points across Chase, American
              Express, and Citi, but finding a good redemption is always a pain.
              <p>
                We had flexibility with points currency, destinations, and
                dates. Our only requirement was securing two round-trip flight
                redemptions in first or business class on the same flight. This
                flexibility came at a cost: we spent over 30 hours across two
                weeks manually searching dates and routes on the websites of
                10-20 airline transfer partners.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, we did find two Japan Airlines first class tickets
                from Los Angeles to Tokyo for 70,000 points each, returning to
                New York for 80,000 points each. These flights typically cost
                between $20,000 to $30,000 roundtrip in cash, but using points,
                we effectively paid only ~$2,000.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first class experience was unforgettable, but we didn't want
                to repeat the tedious search process. So, we decided to build a
                tool to save time in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                I know all this about points might sound a bit like magic, but
                booking cheap business class flights using points is achievable
                for the average person. Here's how it works: Credit card sign-up
                offers range from 50,000 to 150,000 points. These points are
                either tied to credit card currencies (Chase Ultimate Rewards,
                American Express Membership Rewards) or specific airlines (Delta
                Skymiles, United MileagePlus). The most valuable and versatile
                points are tied to credit card currencies because they can be
                transferred to various travel partners. This flexibility allows
                you to choose the best value before transferring points. If you
                only have points with one airline program, you're limited to
                their redemptions.
              </p>
              <p>
                While most people redeem their credit card points through the
                Chase or American Express travel portals at about 1-1.5 cents
                per point, transferring to an airline partner can yield 3-8
                cents per point for business class or 12-20 cents per point for
                first class.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best value for points often comes from non-US airlines like
                Air Canada, Air France/KLM, Avianca, and British Airways. For
                example, you can redeem 50,000 points for an Air France business
                class flight from San Francisco to Paris, which would otherwise
                cost around $4,000. That's an 8 cents per point value,
                significantly higher than using the credit card travel portal.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the challenges are: 1) most people don't know their
                credit card points can transfer to airline partners, 2) they
                don't consider non-US airlines, and 3) manually searching each
                airline website is time-consuming.

                Our tool simplifies this process: Enter your origin airport,
                destination airport, date, fare class, and number of travelers.
                After you click search, our tool searches up to 16 different
                airline loyalty programs in real time and displays the results,
                including flight information, points cost, and redemption
                instructions.

              The purpose of this project is to provide an emulation of the
              on-board Apollo guidance computers, along with some ancillary
              items needed to make the emulation do something interesting. "AGC"
              stands for Apollo Guidance Computer. The AGC was the principal
              on-board computer for NASA's Apollo missions, including all of the
              lunar landings.
