            <div class="text">
              <p>
                Backstory: A few months ago, inspired by things like LangChain
                and LlamaIndex, we started building an AI agent that could work
                with legal contracts. Unfortunately, we couldn't just use
                retrieval augmented generation (RAG), because a lot of contracts
                are basically identical (many chunks with near-identical
                embeddings), except for a few key details. So, we turned to
                things like ReAct and AutoGPT for inspiration.
              </p>
              <p>
                At first, things went great. We were adding agent capabilities,
                doing chain-of-thought prompting.
              </p>
              <p>But then we hit a wall.</p>
              <p>
                The agent became too complex. We had debugger breakpoints on
                almost every line of code, but we still had no idea where the
                agent was breaking. Every change we made destabilized something
                else. After two weeks of fumbling, I decided to end the project.
              </p>
              <p>But one of my teammates, Andy, didn't give up.</p>
              <p>
                The following week, he showed me v0 of Rivet. He'd used it to
                refactor and improve our existing agent. I was skeptical... it
                just seemed like a visual programming environment, and I was not
                a fan. But I gave it a shot, and suddenly found myself able to
                add new skills to the agent, debug brittle areas with ease, and
                update prompts with confidence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rivet is a game-changer. And more than that, it makes building
                with LLMs super fun.
              </p>
              <p>What exactly makes it different?</p>
              <p>
                First, the debugger is incredible. You have to experience it to
                believe it. You can update a graph, and then immediately run it,
                and see where it succeeded or failed. Even better: you can
                attach Rivet as a remote debugger, and watch your agent graphs
                execute in your app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, visual programming is actually a game-changer for
                prompting LLMs. I don't know why exactly, but it's way easier to
                understand and organize your work when you have an extra
                dimension to work with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, Rivet is built to be embedded into a larger application
                (TypeScript for now, but we've also found a way to run it in
                Python). Beyond importing Rivet as a dependency, you can also
                define "external functions" dynamically at run-time. It feels
                pretty sketchy to give a LLM a key and unfettered access to an
                API. With Rivet, you can give it access to a specific set of
                defined functions, potentially pre-scoped to the access level
                you want.
              </p>
              <p>
                ...Sorry that was long. If you read this whole thing, thank you!
              </p>
              <p>
                We're really excited to hear what you think! We just launched
                our first Rivet-based application at Ironclad, and we've been
                working with companies like Sourcegraph, Attentive, AssemblyAI,
                Bento, and Willow to make Rivet useful for others.
