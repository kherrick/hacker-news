            <div class="text">
              <p>
                Fostrom is an IoT Cloud Platform designed for developers to make
                it really easy to get started and scale fleets. We have Device
                SDKs (in Python, JS, Elixir, more coming soon), Typed Schemas,
                Per-Device Mailboxes, Programmable Actions, 4 Global Regions for
                lower-latency connections, and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've built Fostrom to solve a real need we faced in our
                previous startup, building a fully automated indoor vertical
                farm. We spent more time figuring out IoT infrastructure than
                writing automation logic. Fostrom is the platform we wished
                existed back then.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the last few years we've experimented with a lot of
                interesting tech and architectures, and settled on an
                architecture that we believe is quite elegant. We wrote a
                Go&lt;-&gt;Elixir bridge to execute JS code in WASM for Actions,
                implemented a DuckDB library for Elixir, and wrote a Device
                Agent in Rust that our SDKs run in the background (<a
                  href="https://github.com/fostrom/devicekit"
                  >https://github.com/fostrom/devicekit</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                The most interesting realization we had was about the data
                architecture. For years, we tried using distributed databases
                and built complex layers on top of them, but all approaches had
                significant limitations specifically around consistency and
                querying. We want to provide operational correctness, rich
                insights, and reliability. Finally, we came to the conclusion
                that to achieve this we really need a SQL database for fleet
                data. So we built a DuckDB-based replicated multi-tenant data
                layer. We're still improving it (hence the Technical Preview
                badge) but we're quite proud of this decision. It simplifies the
                rest of the codebase, while keeping operational complexity in
                just a few places.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our vision is to make a powerful IoT platform that enables you
                to build correct, secure, and reliable connected systems without
                dealing with any of the plumbing or infrastructure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next up, we're gonna launch our CLI, add automatic device
                monitoring to our Device SDKs, and improve the debugging
                experience. We have some pretty cool ideas to make Fostrom and
                the experience of developing connected systems better. We're
                also going to write more about our architecture and journey
                soon.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also published our launch blog post which goes into more
                detail about our vision, what we've built, and our future plans:

              </p>
              <p>
                Would love for you to try out Fostrom and give us your feedback
                and thoughts.

              <p>
                I tried a few coding orchestrators but most of them were
                Electron/Tauri apps and the performance bugged me. I also just
                prefer the terminal since GUI orchestrators lock you into their
                workflow. So I built cmux as a native macOS app in Swift/AppKit.
                It uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads your
                existing Ghostty config for themes, fonts, colors, and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main additions are the sidebar and notification system. The
                sidebar has vertical tabs that show git branch, working
                directory, listening ports, and the latest notification text for
                each workspace. The notification system picks up terminal
                sequences (OSC 9/99/777) and has a CLI (cmux notify) you can
                wire into agent hooks for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc. When an
                agent is waiting, its pane gets a blue ring and the tab lights
                up in the sidebar, so I can tell which one needs me across
                splits and tabs. Cmd+Shift+U jumps to the most recent unread.
              </p>
              <p>
                The in-app browser has a scriptable API ported from
                agent-browser [1]. Agents can snapshot the accessibility tree,
                get element refs, click, fill forms, evaluate JS, and read
                console logs. You can split a browser pane next to your terminal
                and have Claude Code interact with your dev server directly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything is scriptable through the CLI and socket API – create
                workspaces/tabs, split panes, send keystrokes, open URLs in the
                browser.
              </p>

              <p>
                I built it because I was tired of losing track of everything in
                notes apps, and "I'll remember that"s. When do I need to clean
                the dishwasher filter? What's the best quote for a complete
                overhaul of the backyard. Oops, found some mold behind the trim,
                need to address that ASAP. That sort of stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another reason I made micasa was to build a (hopefully useful)
                low-stakes personal project where the code was written entirely
                by AI. I still review the code and click the merge button, but
                99% of the programming was done with an agent.
              </p>
              <p>Here are some things I think make it worth checking out:</p>
              <p>
                - Vim-style modal UI. Nav mode to browse, edit mode to change.
                Multicolumn sort, fuzzy-jump to columns, pin-and-filter rows,
                hide columns you don't need, drill into related records (like
                quotes for a project). Much of the spirit of the design and some
                of the actual design choices is and are inspired by VisiData.
                You should check that out too. - Local LLM chat. Definitely a
                gimmick, but I am trying preempt "Yeah, but does it AI?"-style
                conversations. This is an optional feature and you can simply
                pretend it doesn't exist. All features work without it. -
                Single-file SQLite-based architecture. Document attachments
                (manuals, receipts, photos) are stored as BLOBs in the same
                SQLite database. One file is the whole app state. If you think
                this won't scale, you're right. It's pretty damn easy to work
                with though. - Pure Go, zero CGO. Built on Charmbracelet for the
                TUI and GORM + go-sqlite for the database. Charm makes pretty
                nice TUIs, and this was my first time using it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Try it with sample data: go install
                github.com/cpcloud/micasa/cmd/micasa@latest &amp;&amp; micasa
                --demo
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're insane you can also run micasa --demo --years 1000 to
                generate 1000 years worth of demo data. Not sure what house
                would last that long, but hey, you do you.
