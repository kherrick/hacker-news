              <a href="https://cuckoo.so">https://cuckoo.so</a>), a real-time AI
              translator for global sales, marketing, and support. Companies
              like Snowflake and PagerDuty use us in Zoom calls and in-person
              meetings, including for technical discussions. Here’s a demo:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKU1fj3rxh4"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKU1fj3rxh4</a
              >.
              <p>
                With Cuckoo, you get an always-available, real-time translator
                that adapts to your conversations, helping teams avoid wasted
                time from language frictions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Language barriers are still a big challenge for companies with
                offices in different countries. I experienced this firsthand at
                my previous company in Korea when I invited international
                speakers to our meetups. Much of the nuance and technical
                details were lost, even though many attendees spoke adequate
                English. Speakers often felt isolated, unable to understand
                Korean discussions, and missed out on opportunities to network
                and market their products—despite these events being organized
                for customer interactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meetings with interpreters are often twice as long, and details
                are lost in translation. Sometimes a bilingual colleague steps
                in as an interpreter, but they’d be far more valuable focusing
                on their core roles. If you are a sales engineer or customer
                success engineer, this gets worse with highly complex and
                technical topics.
              </p>
              <p>
                While LLMs work well for translating written text, they struggle
                with real-time spoken translation. For example, OpenAI’s
                Realtime API only handles turn-by-turn interpretation, which
                doesn’t work for dynamic conversations. One of our customers
                used to record meetings with OBS, upload the recordings to an AI
                notetaker, and wait for translated notes—but that’s hardly
                real-time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cuckoo works by inviting a bot to your Zoom meeting. You can
                contextualize translations by uploading relevant documents like
                pitch decks or product manuals. You can share the live
                transcript with your customers and teammates with a link. It
                also works in person.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve been surprised by the range of use cases. Snowflake uses
                Cuckoo to host international customers in their Customer
                Experience Centers and Weights &amp; Biases runs VIP roundtables
                in Seoul. VP of Sales at a high-growth startup closed enterprise
                deals in Japan and an early-stage founder in SF connected with
                their first user in Turkey.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of our users include engineers who face language barriers
                in technical conversations. For example, a solution engineer at
                PagerDuty uses Cuckoo to troubleshoot integrations with local
                partners in Korea and Japan. These conversations are often full
                of technical jargon, APIs, and organizational context. By
                uploading relevant documents like API docs, they ensure
                translations are accurate and context-aware, reducing
                misunderstandings and inefficiencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Privacy and Security: like human interpreters, we sign NDAs
                to protect sensitive information. Transcripts can be set to
                self-destruct after meetings, and we’re working toward ISO 27001
                and SOC I/II certifications. If you delete your account, all
                associated data is erased immediately and irreversibly.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can sign up with just an email and name. After signing up,
                you can copy and paste your Zoom or MS Teams link to have Cuckoo
                join your meeting. We provide a quick 60-minute free trial, but
                if you need more, please let me know at yonghee@cuckoo.so. We’d
                be happy to extend it for HN users!.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best way to understand Cuckoo is to try it out for one of
                your upcoming global meetings. It takes &lt;3 minutes to get
                started. We’re looking forward to hearing your thoughts and
                feedback in the comments!

                The agent can edit multiple files, run gradle tasks like tests,
                and use the output to improve its changes. At the end, it
                reports a git diff of all changes that can be accepted or
                rejected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, the agent relies on Claude 3.7 sonnet and a fast
                code apply model to speed up edits. We built tools to give
                deeper access throughout the IDE like IntelliJ’s graph
                representation of kotlin/java code, “everywhere search” for
                classes, and have more integrations planned. The goal is for the
                agent to have access to all the IDE goodies that we engineers
                take for granted, to improve the agent's responses and ability
                to gather correct context. In order to improve the agent, there
                are internal evals like “tasks” and simulate the IDE which
                serves as a gym for the agent. This is heavily inspired by
                SWE-bench. Whenever tools, prompts, subagents, or models are
                changed, this gym helps find regressions quickly.

                Building the UI was surprisingly hard. I had the great pleasure
                of becoming proficient in Java Swing (released in ‘96 by
                Netscape) to get this done right. Things like markdown
                streaming, or streaming git diffs are prone to layout flickering
                where Swing tries to recalculate where elements should go. We
                had to write our own markdown parsing and rendering engine that
                repaints Swing components only when changed portions of the
                markdown nodes. The UI tends to focus on simplifying reviewing
                AI changes, something I have a feeling we’ll be doing much more
                in the coming years.

                into any bugs or want anything improved in the plugin!

                But I'm curious in practice how much actual employee resume
                verification is done? Do people even check if they've graduated
                the colleges they say they have, or have evidence of employment
                of somewhere they've noted down? What about job titles?
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm also wondering how thorough current FAANG-type companies
                are. This topic came to mind after seeing a 'resume prank' video
                where someone came up with a ridiculous and troll-ish resume
                (with rude and offensive jokes in the bullet points), but had
                'Stanford', 'Amazon', etc, and so he got about 30 out of 100
                interviews applying to top (US) tech companies. Is this fakery
                something that would get someone caught further down the line
                perhaps?
              </p>
              <p>
                Just been very curious how this all works in practice lately.
                I've done some hiring in the past and typically I'll just call
                contact references (who I can't even ensure are real people
                tbh). Of the few times I've requested a transcript, I take it at
                face value and have no way of telling if it's doctored.

                Since our launch ten months ago, my cofounder and I have

                However, given there are only two of us right now competing in
                the "best model and average user UI" race we haven't had the
                time to build some of the really neat ideas our users and pro
                musicians have been dreaming up (e..g, DAW plugins, live
                performance transition generators, etc). The hacker musician
                community has a rich history of taking new tech and doing really
                cool and unexpected stuff with it, too.
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, we're opening up an API that gives full access to the
                features of our underlying diffusion model (e.g., generation,
                inpainting, extensions, transition generation, inverse
                sampling). Here are some things our early test users are already
                doing with it:

                We'd love to hear what you think, and are open to answering any
                tech questions about our model too! It's still a latent
                diffusion model, but much larger and with a much better GAN
                decoder.

              <p>There’s 2 parts to this:</p>
              <p>
                1. An agents.json file describes how to link API calls together
                into outcome-based tools for LLMs. This file sits alongside an
                OpenAPI file.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. The agents.json SDK loads agents.json files as tools for an
                LLM that can then be executed as a series of API calls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why is this worth building? Developers are realizing that to use
                tools with their LLMs in a stateless way, they have to implement
                an API manually to work with LLMs. We see devs sacrifice
                agentic, non-deterministic behavior for hard-coded workflows to
                create outcomes that can work. agents.json lets LLMs be
                non-deterministic for the outcomes they want to achieve and
                deterministic for the API calls it takes to get there.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve put together some real examples if you're curious what the
                final output looks like. Under the hood, these LLMs have the
                same system prompt and we plug in a different agents.json to
                give access to different APIs. It’s all templatized.

                We really wanted to solve real production use cases, and knew
                this couldn’t just be a proxy. Our approach allows you to make
                API calls from your own infrastructure. The open-source
                specification + runner package make this paradigm possible.
                Agents.json is truly stateless; the client manages all
                memory/state and it can be deployed on existing infra like
                serverless environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might be wondering - <i>isn’t OpenAPI enough?</i> Why can’t
                I just put that in the LLM’s context?

              <p>
                We thought so too, at first, when building an agent with access
                to Gmail. But putting the API spec into LLM context gave us poor
                accuracy in tool selection and in tool calling. Even with
                cutting down our output space to 5-10 endpoints, we’d see the
                LLMs fail to select the right tool. We wanted the LLM to just
                work given an outcome rather than having it reason each time
                which series of API calls to make.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Gmail API, for example, has endpoints to search for threads,
                list the emails in a thread, and reply with an email given
                base64 RFC 822 content. All that has to happen in order with the
                right arguments for our agent to reply to a thread. We found
                that APIs are designed for developers, not for LLMs.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we implemented agents.json. It started off as a config file
                we were using internally that we slowly started adding features
                to like auth registration, tool search, and multiple API
                sources. 3 weeks ago, Dharmesh (CTO of Hubspot) posted about the
                concept of a specification that could translate APIs for LLMs.
                It sounded a lot like what we already had working internally and
                we decided to make it open source. We built agents.json for
                ourselves but we’re excited to share it.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the weeks since we’ve put it out there, agents.json has 10
                vetted API integrations (some of them official) and more are
                being added every day. We recently made the tool search and
                custom collection platform free for everyone so it’s even easier
                for devs to scale the number of tools. (<a

                agents or creating APIs!

                My latest side project is knowledge graph that maps the French
                culinary network using data extracted from restaurant reviews
                from LeFooding.com. The project uses LLMs to extract structured
                information from unstructured text.
              </p>
              <p>Some technical aspects you may be interested in:</p>
              <p>
                - Used structured generation to reliably parse unstructured text
                into a consistent schema
              </p>
              <p>
                - Tested multiple models (Mistral-7B-v0.3, Llama3.2-3B,
                gpt4o-mini) for information extraction
              </p>
              <p>
                - Created an interactive visualization using gephi-lite and
                Retina (WebGL)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Built (with Claude) a simple Flask web app to clean and
                deduplicate the data
              </p>
              <p>
                - Total cost for inferencing 2000 reviews with gpt4o-mini: less
                than 1€!
