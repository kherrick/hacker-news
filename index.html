                I know that labs, institutions, and so on have safety teams. I
                know the folks doing that work are serious and earnest about
                that work. But at this point are these institutions merely
                pandering to the notion of safety with some token level of
                investment? In the way that a Casino might fund programs to
                address gambling addiction.

                introspection - URL discovery and testing
              </p>
              <p>All of these tools have been built inside the Django admin.</p>
              <p>
                Instead of jumping between tools like Flower, redis-cli,
                Swagger, or external services, I wanted something that sits
                where I’m already working.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve grouped these under a single umbrella: Django Control Room.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea is pretty simple: the Django admin already gives you
                authentication, permissions, and a familiar interface. It can
                also act as an operational layer for your app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each panel is just a small Django app with a simple interface,
                so it’s easy to build your own and plug it in.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m working on more panels (signals, errors, etc.) and also
                thinking about how far this pattern can go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Curious how others think about this. Does it make sense to
                consolidate this kind of tooling inside the admin, or do you
                prefer keeping it separate?

              We build an AI agent that plans company events from start to
              finish entirely through conversation. Similar to how Lovable helps
              build websites through chat, we apply that approach to event
              planning. Our system handles venue sourcing, vendor coordination,
              flight cost estimation, itinerary building, and overall project
              management.
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                We went through YC in 2022 but did not launch on HN at the time.
                Back then, the product was more traditional, closer to an
                Airbnb-style search marketplace. Over the past two years, after
                helping organize more than 1,200 events, we rebuilt the core
                system around an agent architecture that directly manages the
                planning process. With this new version live, it felt like the
                right moment to share it here since it represents a
                fundamentally different approach to planning events.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem: Planning a company retreat usually means choosing
                between three imperfect options: (1) Hire an event planner and
                pay significant fees and venue markups; (2) Do it yourself and
                spend dozens of hours on research, emails, and negotiation; or
                (3) Use tools like Airbnb that are not designed for group
                logistics or meeting space.
              </p>
              <p>
                The difficulty is not just finding a venue. Even for 30 to 50
                people, planning turns into weeks of back-and-forth emails for
                quotes, comparing inconsistent pricing across PDFs, and tracking
                budgets in spreadsheets. It becomes an ongoing coordination
                problem with evolving constraints and slow, asynchronous vendor
                responses. Most existing software is form-driven, but the real
                workflow is conversational and stateful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Offsites are expensive and high stakes. A single event can
                represent a significant chunk of a team’s annual budget, and
                mistakes show up directly as cost overruns or poor experiences.
                Founders and operators often end up spending time on event
                logistics instead of their actual work.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ran into this while organizing retreats at a previous company.
                Before TeamOut, I worked as an AI researcher at IBM on NLP and
                machine learning systems. Sitting inside long email threads and
                cost spreadsheets, it did not look like a marketplace gap to me.
                It looked like a reasoning and state management problem. As
                large language models improved at multi-step reasoning and tool
                use, it became realistic to automate the coordination layer
                itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Solution: The core agent relies on a combination of models
                such as Gemini, Claude, and GPT. A central LLM-based agent
                maintains planning context across turns and decides which
                specialized tool to call next. Each tool has a specific
                responsibility: - Venue search and filtering - Cost estimations
                (accommodation + flights) - Budget comparisons - Quote and
                outreach flows - Communication tool with our team
              </p>
              <p>
                For venue recommendations across more than 10,000 venues, we do
                not rely purely on the language model. We embed both user
                requirements and venues into vector representations and retrieve
                candidates using similarity search. Hard constraints such as
                capacity and dates are applied first, and results are ranked
                before being presented.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the interface side, we use a split layout: conversation on
                the left and structured results on the right. As you refine the
                plan in chat, the event updates in real time, allowing an
                iterative workflow rather than a static search experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                What is different is that we treat event planning as a stateful
                coordination problem rather than a one-shot search query. The
                agent orchestrates tools, manages evolving constraints, and
                surfaces trade-offs explicitly. It does not invent venues or
                fabricate pricing, and it is not designed to replace human
                planners for very large or highly customized events.
              </p>
              <p>
                We make money from commissions on venue bookings. It is free for
                teams to explore options and plan. If you’ve organized an
                offsite or large meetup before, I’d genuinely value your
                perspective. Where would you expect this to fail? What edge
                cases are we underestimating? Where wouldn’t you trust an agent
                to handle the details?
              </p>
              <p>
                My engineering team and I will be here all day to answer
                questions, happy to go deep on architecture, tradeoffs, and
                lessons learned. We’d really appreciate your candid feedback.

              <p>
                Because of this, I wanted to create a game environment that put
                this generation of frontier LLMs' top skill, coding, on full
                display.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ten years ago, a team released a game called Screeps. It was
                described as an "MMO RTS sandbox for programmers." The Screeps
                paradigm of writing code and having it executed in a real-time
                game environment is well suited to LLMs. Drawing on a version of
                the Screeps open source API, LLM Skirmish pits LLMs head-to-head
                in a series of 1v1 real-time strategy games.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my testing I found that Claude Opus 4.5 was the most dominant
                model, but it showed weakness in round 1 as it was overly
                focused on its in-game economy. Meanwhile, I probably spent a
                third of all code on sandbox hardening because GPT 5.2 kept
                trying to cheat by pre-reading its opponent's strategies.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there's interest, I'm planning on doing a round of testing
                with the latest generation of LLMs (Claude 4.6 Opus, GPT 5.3
                Codex, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can run local matches via CLI. I'm running a hosted match
                runner with Google Cloud Run that uses isolated-vm. The match
                playback visualizer is statically served from Cloudflare.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've created a community ladder that you can submit strategies
                to via CLI, no auth required. I've found that the CLI plus the
                skill.md that's available has been enough for AI agents to
                immediately get started.

              I wanted to share our new speech to text model, and the library to
              use them effectively. We're a small startup (six people, sub-$100k
              monthly GPU budget) so I'm proud of the work the team has done to
              create streaming STT models with lower word-error rates than
              OpenAI's largest Whisper model. Admittedly Large v3 is a couple of
              years old, but we're near the top the HF OpenASR leaderboard, even
              up against Nvidia's Parakeet family. Anyway, I'd love to get
              feedback on the models and software, and hear about what people
              might build with it.

                Emdash is an open-source and provider-agnostic desktop app that
                lets you run multiple coding agents in parallel, each isolated
                in its own git worktree, either locally or over SSH on a remote
                machine. We call it an Agentic Development Environment (ADE).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see a 1 minute demo here:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/X31nK-zlzKo"

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We are building Emdash for ourselves. While working on a
                cap-table management application (think Stripe Atlas + Pulley),
                we found our development workflow to be messy: lots of
                terminals, lots of branches, and too much time spent waiting on
                Codex.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emdash puts the terminal at the center and makes it easy to run
                multiple agents at once. Each agent runs as a task in its own
                git worktree. You can start one or a few agents on the same
                problem, test, and review.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emdash works over SSH so you can run agents where your code
                lives and keep the parallel workflow. You can assign tickets to
                agents, edit files manually, and review changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also spent time making task startup fast. Each task can be
                created in a worktree, and creating worktrees on demand was
                taking 5s+ in some cases. We now keep a small reserve of
                worktrees in the background and let a new task claim one
                instantly. That brought task start time down to ~500–1000ms
                depending on the provider. We also spawn the shell directly and
                avoid loading the shell environments on startup.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe using the providers’ native CLIs is the right
                approach. It gives you the full capabilities of each agent,
                always. If a provider starts supporting plan mode, we don't have
                to add that first.
              </p>
              <p>
                We support 21 coding agent CLIs today, including Claude Code,
                Codex, Gemini, Droid, Amp, Codebuff, and more. We auto-detect
                what you have installed and we’re provider-agnostic by design.
                If there’s a provider you want that we don’t support yet, we can
                add it. We believe that in the future, some agents will be
                better suited for task X and others for task Y. Codex, Claude
                Code, and Gemini all have fans. We want to be agnostic and
                enable individuals and teams to freely switch between them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond orchestration, we try to pull most of the development
                loop into Emdash. You can review diffs, commit, open PRs, see
                CI/CD checks, and merge directly from Emdash once checks pass.
                When starting a task, you can pass issues from Linear, GitHub,
                and Jira to an agent. We also support convenience variables and
                lifecycle scripts so it’s easy to allocate ports and test
                changes.
              </p>
              <p>Emdash is fully open-source and MIT-licensed.</p>
              <p>
                Download for macOS, Linux or Windows (as of yesterday !), or
                install via Homebrew: brew install --cask emdash.

                We’d love your feedback. How does your coding agent development
                setup look like, especially when working with multiple agents?

              <p>
                I built it because I was tired of Scheme/Lisp's raggy
                development environment, especially of the lack of IDE-like
                highly customized programing experience. Though DrRacket and
                many REPL-based counterparts have don't much, following general
                cases aren't reach same-level as in other modern languages:
                (let* ([ready-for-reference 1]
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>         [call-reference (+ ready-for-)]))

</code></pre>
              Apparently, the `ready-for-` behind `call-reference` should
              trigger an auto-complete option, in which has a candidate
              `ready-for-reference`. Besides, I also know both of them have the
              type of number, and their available scope is limited by `let*`'s
              outer brackets. I wish some IDE to provide such features and such
              small wishes gradually accumulated in past ten years, finally I
              wasn't satisfied with all the ready-made products.
              <p>
                If you want some further information, you may refer my github
                repository in which has a screen-record video showing how you
                code get help from this project and this project has detailed
                documentation so don't hesitate and use it.
              </p>
              <p>Here're some other things sharing to Hacker News readers:</p>
              <p>
                1. Why I don't use DrRacket: LSP follows KISS(Keep It Simple,
                Stupid) principle and I don't want to be involved with font
                things as I just read in its github issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. What's the newest stage of scheme-langserve: It achieves kind
                of self-boost, in which stage I can continue develop it with its
                VScode plugin help. However, I directly used Chez Scheme's
                tokenizer and this leaded to several un-caught exceptions whom I
                promise to be fixed in the future, but I'm occupied with
                developing new feature. If you feel something wrong with
                scheme-langserver, you may reboot vscode, generally this always
                work.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Technology road map: I'm now developing a new macro expander
                so that the users can customize LSP behavior by coding their own
                macro and without altering this project. After this, I have a
                plan to improve efficiency and fix bugs. 4. Do I need any help:
                Yes. And I'd like to say, talking about scheme-langserver with
                me is also a kind of help.
              </p>
              <p>
                5. Long-term View: I suspect 2 or 3 years later I will lose
                concentration on this project but according some of my friends,
                I may integrate this project with other fantastic work.
