                We built this because current API tools donâ€™t deal with the fact
                that some APIs are just painful to work with. For us, itâ€™s
                usually error after error as we try to figure out how to
                properly form the first request.
              </p>
              <p>
                We recorded a demo to show you how TypeScript helps us
                autocomplete a request correctly.

                How does our platform improve the developer experience? The
                analogy is similar to using a statically typed language vs
                dynamically typed. Most API tools are dynamically typed. Youâ€™re
                guessing the params and relying on the request to magically work
                at runtime, only for you to go back to stack overflow or the
                docs when it doesnâ€™t.
              </p>
              <p>
                We take the approach of defining parameters and the schema
                first. When you add a new parameter, you need to mention upfront
                if itâ€™s required and what type it is (integer, string, boolean).
                While this can be painful in the beginning, it will save you and
                anyone you share this with the hassle of understanding how this
                API works.

                Our app is cross-platform on web and desktop. Our desktop app is
                &lt;20mb and built on top of Rust with Tauri, NextJS, and
                Supabase. We open source our code because we want to be
                transparent about how API requests and secrets are handled (all
                local IndexDB).

                I built the first version of this at Robinhood when my
                colleagues were sharing bash scripts and internal APIs on slack
                to test things. I wanted to make it easier for anyone to use an
                API quickly and made use of our OpenAPI specs to generate a nice
                autocomplete API tool. Soon after, the Options team, then the
                Crypto team, and then the whole eng org at Robinhood adopted
                this tool!

                As you know, serious vulnerabilities are common in IoT, and it
                often takes too long for these to be patched on end-user
                devicesâ€”if the manufacturer even bothers to release an update,
                and if the device was even designed to receive them. Companies
                may stop supporting a device well before consumers have stopped
                using it. The support period is often not communicated at the
                time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even
                announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their
                devices are still safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Iâ€™ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to
                support their devices with security updates for a reasonable
                amount of time [1]. I can't bring such a proposal to a vote
                since Iâ€™m not the chairman of the agency. But I was able to
                convince my colleagues to tentatively support something a little
                more moderate addressing this problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                The FCC recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for
                a cybersecurity labeling program for connected devices. If they
                meet certain criteria for the security of their product,
                manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it. I fought
                hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long
                the product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides
                arming consumers with better information, the commitments on
                this label (including the support period) will be legally
                enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under other laws.
                You can see my full statement here [3].
              </p>
              <p>
                But itâ€™s too early to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose
                making any commitments about security updates, even voluntary
                ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged at the FCC and
                represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and
                White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only
                hear the device manufacturer's side of the story.
              </p>
              <p>
                In short, they need to hear from you. You have experienced
                insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious
                security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample
                warning. People ask, â€˜why arenâ€™t there rules about these
                things?â€™ This is your chance to get on the record and tell us
                what you think the rules should be. If infosec doesnâ€™t make this
                an issue, the general public will continue falsely assuming that
                everything is fine. But if you get on the record and the
                government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be
                all over the Internet forever.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to influence the process, you have until September
                25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking
                proceeding.[4] Filing is easy: go to
                <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239"
                  >https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239</a
                >
                and click to file either an â€˜expressâ€™ comment (type into a
                textbox) or a â€˜standardâ€™ comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the
                FCC is required to consider your arguments. All options are on
                the table, so donâ€™t hold back, but do make your arguments as
                clear as possible, so even lawyers can understand them. If you
                have a qualification (line of work, special degree, years of
                experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your
                official comment, be sure to mention that, but the only
                necessary qualification is being an interested member of the
                public.

                Iâ€™m here to listen and learn. AMA. Feel free to ask any
                questions about this or related issues, and Iâ€™ll answer as many
                as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of
                security. My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused
                software engineer turned cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering
                questions too. Iâ€™m open to incorporating your ideas (and even
                being convinced Iâ€™m wrong), and I hope that my colleagues at the

                I wanted to show a sneak peak of something I've been working on
                the for the past few months.
              </p>
              <p>
                I build a lot of projects that involve static hosting and became
                frustrated by how complicated it is in 2023. All I need to do is
                move files from my CI onto a server that can serve the files. It
                shouldn't be as complicated as it is on GCP, AWS, etc. And the
                ones that are marketed as easy (e.g. Cloudflare Pages, surge.sh)
                still require the end-user to install a tool first.
              </p>
              <p>
                With pgs.sh the user doesn't need to install anything. Signup is
                as simple as SSHing into pgs.sh and creating an account.
                Creating new static sites is as easy as copying files to pgs.sh.
              </p>
              <p>
                To go even further, we have added features like instant
                promotion and rollback to make it easier to manage deployments
                safely.
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire service can be managed via SSH commands. Pasted below
                is our help SSH command:

              <p>
                This service is in closed beta, but if you join our irc channel
                #pico.sh @ libera.chat we will invite you to test it out.

                I've been dipping in and out of this problem space for the last
                few years with many of my clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                Puck sits somewhere between an old-school WYSIWYG-powered CMS
                and headless one, allowing content teams to author content using
                real React components.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional CMS solutions were flexible but often resulted in
                page that completely broke the brand guidelines. Headless CMS
                solutions are a fantastic way of controlling brand by
                restricting UI changes to developers, but makes layout changes
                restrictive and slow as developers often need to get involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Puck provides a visual editor for React that can sit on top of
                your existing headless CMS (or act as standalone). We've been
                dog-fooding it on a few pages at
                <a href="https://measured.co">https://measured.co</a> and on
                <a href="https://wellpaid.io">https://wellpaid.io</a>. So far,
                so good
              </p>
              <p>
                The API is built for React, which allows FE devs to quickly
                integrate their existing component and add some form fields for
                author input, or connect it to a headless CMS of choice.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's open-source under MIT, and pairs nicely with Next.js (check
                out the demo application). Next in the pipeline: support for
                multi-column layouts, richer demos, new plugins.
              </p>

              <a href="https://nullstone.io">https://nullstone.io</a>), a
              developer platform to deploy and manage cloud apps and
              infrastructure. Hereâ€™s a demo:
              <a
                href="https://www.loom.com/share/924b1f57ba2143eeabb43ee8cbe3fe88?sid=91afe471-e5ac-462d-829a-1f762f3ab2fd"

              <p>
                Running your app on a major cloud provider makes a lot of things
                easier, but itâ€™s tedious to configure IAM, security groups,
                networking, secrets, autoscaling, health checks, zero-downtime
                deployments, and more. It is also difficult and time-consuming
                to release and synchronize app and infra changes across many
                apps and environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nullstone provides an intuitive developer experience to deploy
                any appâ€”be it an API, web app, static site, or one-off jobâ€”to
                AWS or GCP. We provide a simple, consistent experience for
                automatically deploying to any platform (e.g., Fargate,
                Kubernetes, Lambda, etc.). We provision and configure
                infrastructure depending on your use case (e.g., networks,
                clusters, datastores, load balancers, third-party logging
                providers, and much more). We offer many features that are hard
                to build in-house: automatic secrets management, GitOps, and
                preview environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything runs in your own cloud accounts. You own your data
                and we cannot access it. Secrets are stored in your secrets
                manager. We support all app types (e.g. APIs, web apps,
                frontends, jobs, etc.) and platforms (e.g. containers,
                serverless, s3 sites, VMs, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of being a black box, our infrastructure modules are
                open source and you can hot-swap each module for your own
                Terraform. You can automate deploys and preview environments via
                GitHub integrations, CI/CD integrations, CLI, or API. All
                infra/deploy logs are easily accessible through the UI, CLI, and
                API.
              </p>
              <p>
                We scan our modules against compliance frameworks to provide a
                foundation of compliance for your infrastructure. If there are
                vendors or platforms we donâ€™t support, we provide a quick
                framework and open hooks to add support.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nullstone is intended for software teams that donâ€™t want to
                build an in-house platform. Our customers span many industries
                and have used us to reduce cloud costs by up to 90%, provide
                developer self-service, fully automate deployments, migrate to
                containers, and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Previously, we built an internal developer platform at McKinsey
                (serving 300 workloads across 1000 engineers) to solve a major
                pain point: engineers were building apps in weeks only to wait
                months to provision and secure infrastructure (and once
                provisioned, making changes to the apps was a frustrating
                back-and-forth process). Later I joined a cybersecurity company
                and as our team grew, I saw the same challenges: we were
                spending more time configuring infrastructure than building the
                product.
              </p>
              <p>
                We decided to build Nullstone because no existing solution fit
                our needs. Some of the products we found were all-in-one
                solutions, meaning we had to sacrifice the tooling we liked and
                use infrastructure with insufficient security, compliance, and
                reliability controls. Other products, built for enterprises,
                provide a poor developer experience in exchange for costly
                licenses and significant internal resources to operate.
              </p>
              <p>
                To provide a fully customizable experience that is easy-to-use
                for developers, we had to solve a few problems. (1) We had to
                present infrastructure as code configuration in a way that isnâ€™t
                overwhelming, but allows for flexibility to handle various
                architectures. (2) We had to insulate developers from
                infrastructure-as-code errors that would confuse them, while
                maintaining a level of transparency that devs demand. (3) We had
                to build tooling around module development because
                infrastructure takes 10x longer than app code to get feedback on
                whether itâ€™s working properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nullstone is free for individual use. After that, we charge
                $100/user/month. A user is anybody committing code that is
                deployed through Nullstone.
