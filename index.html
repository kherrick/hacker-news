                >https://www.atpatchwork.com/</a
              >). We’re building a communication tool for teams that lets you
              stay in sync while at the same time staying in flow. It’s centered
              around a ranked feed instead of chat.
              <p>
                Over the last several years, we’ve noticed that it’s getting
                increasingly difficult to stay in flow. We believe it’s because
                chat (i.e. Slack, Teams, and similar tools) has evolved into
                something it wasn’t designed for. Chat originally served as a
                way to free us from our desk by giving us the safety that if we
                were needed for immediate matters, people could reach us. Now
                it’s become a dumping ground for all communication: daily
                updates, product and engineering discussions, announcements,
                etc. Both of us still reminisce about the days of in-office
                work, before Slack became mainstream, where everyone abided by
                the headphone rule—the unwritten pact that headphones meant
                someone was in deep work and not to bother them unless you
                really needed to. Compared to then, the onus has now shifted to
                be on us to determine which chats are urgent and should take us
                out of flow vs. which messages can be responded to later. It
                feels like the very tool that was meant to liberate us instead
                made us beholden to its pings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Patchwork is our attempt to solve this problem by shifting the
                primary communication model from group chats to feeds. Posts are
                made in relevant groups and each team member has a home feed
                personalized to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The feed algorithm evaluates each post's relevance and urgency
                based on a bunch of factors, including the post’s content,
                user's role, ongoing projects, and recent interactions. Our goal
                is to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio with our feed’s
                algorithm so we can surface the most important information
                first. When you’re not in flow or in between meetings, you can
                check the feed to stay in sync.
              </p>
              <p>
                There have been feed-based work communication products before,
                but they’ve often overlooked the fact that writing a post has
                more friction than writing a chat message, which is why people
                often revert back to doing everything over chat. We’re combating
                this by using LLMs to create a better writing experience (ie.
                generate title and tl;dr, simplify selected content, change the
                tone, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                As a product team ourselves, we know that much of our work
                happens on different platforms. We’re building integrations with
                the likes of Github, Linear, Figma, GSuite etc. Having all of
                this activity from different platforms also rolling into our
                feeds allows us to stay in sync with all the different work
                being done on our team instead of having to check various
                sources of data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, we do have chat on the platform, but chat looks and
                feels like chat. It’s meant to be used for immediate needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a demo of the product:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA3rmSjNjDw"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA3rmSjNjDw</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Since it’s a team communication product, it's hard to use it in
                single player mode, so we don’t have a “try it now” link to jump
                straight in. But you’re welcome to email us at
                hackernews@atpatchwork.com and we’ll onboard your team.
              </p>
              <p>
                The product is still early with a basic feed, a few
                integrations, and simple LLM assisted post creation, but the
                main flow is already there, so if the message resonates with
                you, we’d love for you to give it a try.
              </p>
              <p>
                More importantly, we’d love to hear your ideas about team
                communication and getting it back to working <i>for</i> people,
                not <i>at</i> them!

                smartphone.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my case the infra is pretty simple : 3 Raspberry Pi. But I'd
                love to have your feedback and see interesting use cases you
                could use this for.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have lots of ideas for the next steps. For example, creating a
                Prometheus integration as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking forward to hearing from you and I would be glad to help
                if you encounter any issue getting started with the repo.

                I’d love to introduce Figr Identity, which helps you generate
                design systems with variables, styles, Styles sheets and custom
                components in your design language. We built this plugin to take
                away the non-creative work from the design system setup process.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Setup the design tokens: Colours, typography, corner radius,
                spacing system, grids and elevation.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Setup the component Library: All the design tokens are
                automatically reflected in custom component library.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Export to Figma: Get the style guideline, variables, and
                component library to your file in a single click.
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love to hear your feedback as we continue to improve the
                plugin :)

              <p>
                When I was studying at MIT, I often had to wait 40-60 minutes in
                line just to get 5 minutes of “help” from a TA - when I needed
                1-2 hours. I understood that TAs can’t spend all their time
                helping me. That’s understandable. But what made me bitter was
                that, the school went the extra mile to ensure I don’t have the
                resources to learn on my own,
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Blocking access to solutions for past problems (to prevent
                cheating)
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Purposely not recording explanations to increase attendance:
                https://piazza.com/class/ky0jj3k89mz5d2/post/9
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Insisting that Office Hours is a 1-by-1 format even when
                crowded (to prevent solutions from leaking)
              </p>
              <p>
                These policies have good intentions - it’s to encourage a
                synchronous, in-person learning experience. But in practice, it
                had side-effects:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Help resources become inefficient - because so much material
                is restricted, and so much time is spent on delivering live
                lectures, there’d often be 40 students competing for help from 2
                TAs in a 2-hour Office Hours
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Because help resources are inefficient, it’s very hard to
                catch-up: once you fall behind, you have no way to review past
                material efficiently enough to compensate the difference - like
                credit card debt
              </p>
              <p>
                3.Every day, I’d wake up, go to a lecture I don’t understand, go
                to Office Hours so I can hopefully ask for a review (which’d
                would take a few hours), realize TAs aren’t willing to do that,
                then realize there is nothing I can do to recover. I fell into a
                depression for many years, and my bitterness fueled me to work
                on the early versions of explanations.app
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out that universities succeed by being prestigious, not
                by teaching well. To win at prestige, be highly selective (by
                keeping supply low), keep a huge endowment (because it affects
                school rankings), and hire the best researchers (not teachers).
                This is actually the fundamental reason for the odd incentives
                in higher education, and something felt wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
                So explanations.app is completely inspired by KhanAcademy and
                Youtube. The mystery to me was - why weren’t there more Youtube
                teachers &amp; KhanAcademy videos? I believe it’s a combination
                of:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. People who teach college subjects well often have better
                opportunities e.g. work, research
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Lack of rewards: even Youtubers with 100K views and 10K
                subscribers would have at most 1-5 paying members on Patreon
              </p>
              <p>
                On the one hand, there are all these free resources, where
                teachers changed the world way more than they ever got rewarded
                for. Then on the other hand, there is private tutoring - very
                effective - but very expensive e.g. $100/hour for college level
                subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe the balanced solution is a system where lots of
                students pay $10/week to a few teachers who make videos, like a
                paid, Q&amp;A Youtube/KhanAcademy, so it’s personalized,
                effective, but still affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are currently 2 teachers on explanations.app - Ben &amp;
                Esther - both MIT grads, teaching physics &amp; math for
                subjects like linear algebra and electromagnetism. 3 students -
                Laquazia, Lidija and Chandra from US, Serbia and Korea joined
                this month following r/physicsStudents launch:
                [https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1b2t5u6/i_started_a_program_where_mit_grads_do_physics/]
              </p>
              <p>
                While explanations.app is focused on college-level math and
                physics, the platform is completely open for anyone to learn
                and/or teach. I hope you can try it :^) and give me the chance
                to work with you.
