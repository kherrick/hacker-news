              <a href="https://www.frigade.com">https://www.frigade.com</a>), a
              developer tool for building high-quality product onboarding.
              Here’s a demo video:
              <a href="https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4"
                >https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4</a

              <p>
                Onboarding is a critical first experience for software products.
                It makes a big difference for customer activation and retention.
                However, onboarding experiences often do not get the attention
                they deserve because, without good tooling, they’re a pain to
                build. At a previous startup, Christian and I were surprised at
                how hard it was to get right. It took a ton of time that would
                otherwise have gone to our core product. We also knew that much
                better tooling was possible because we had experienced it in the
                internal tooling at LinkedIn, where we worked at a previous job.
              </p>
              <p>
                Established software companies such as LinkedIn, Uber, Vanta,
                and many others invest in internal developer platforms to give
                their team unfair advantages, like the ability to quickly build
                great onboarding experiences. But these platforms only get built
                at scale. With Frigade, our goal is to develop the platform that
                every growth engineering team would love to have, but can’t
                afford to build themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are no-code tools for onboarding (e.g. Pendo, Appcues,
                Intercom), but they’re rigid and clumsy. They’re built for
                marketers and managers rather than developers, so they sit on
                top of your product instead of feeling native. They’re not
                defined in your codebase, frequently break without teams
                noticing, and there are limits to what you can build with them.
                Unlike these tools, Frigade uses native SDKs and provides an API
                for developers to build new onboardings in code.
              </p>
              <p>
                How to use Frigade in your product: first install our SDK (React
                for now); choose a production-ready Frigade UI component or go
                headless; create a “Frigade Flow” in our admin panel and hook it
                up to the SDK (Flows are where you set the logic, targeting,
                content, and more); publish your flow to go live.
              </p>
              <p>
                Frigade automatically tracks users’ progress through your Flows.
                Your team can sign in to our admin panel to see which customers
                have completed what steps or input data, and you can use our API
                to sync tracking events to your analytics platform, send drip
                campaign (emails that guide users through setup), or show
                product reminders (e.g. “Finish connecting your data” banners).
                Frigade leverages server-driven UI, so once a Flow is live, you
                can easily update content (e.g. change copy, add another step)
                and logic (e.g. who should see it and when) in real-time without
                new code deploys.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve spent most of our time building out the platform with
                early customers so far, but our self-serve flow is (ironically)
                coming soon. In the meantime, our demo video gives you the basic
                picture:

                  >https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4</a
                >. Please let us know if you’re interested in trying Frigade,
                we’d love to get your feedback on what we’ve built so far! We
                work mostly with web-based B2B companies today, and our pricing
                is competitive with other tools on the market.
              </p>
              <p>
                What has been your experience with product onboarding? We’d love
                to hear more about examples of what’s worked well and what’s
                been a pain in the ass—as well as anything else you’d like to
                share.

              <a href="https://bloop.ai/">https://bloop.ai/</a>), a code search
              engine which combines semantic search with GPT-4 to answer
              questions. We let you search your private codebases either the
              traditional way (regex or literal) or via semantic search, ask
              questions in natural language thanks to GPT-4, and jump between
              refs/defs with precise code navigation. Here’s a quick demo:
              <a
                href="https://www.loom.com/share/8e9d59b88dd2409482ec02cdda5b9185"
                >https://www.loom.com/share/8e9d59b88dd2409482ec02cdda5b9185</a
              >
              <p>
                Traditional code search tools match the terms in your query
                against the codebase, but often you don’t know the right terms
                to start with, e.g. ‘Which library do we use for model
                inference?’ (These types of questions are particularly common
                when you’re learning a new codebase.) bloop uses a combination
                of neural semantic code search (comparing the meaning - encoded
                in vector representations - of queries and code snippets) and
                chained LLM calls to retrieve and reason about abstract queries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ideally, a LLM could answer questions about your code directly,
                but there is significant overhead (and expense) in fine-tuning
                the largest LLMs on private data. And although they’re
                increasing, prompt sizes are still a long way off being able to
                fit a whole organisation’s codebase.
              </p>
              <p>
                We get around these limitations with a two-step process. First,
                we use GPT-4 to generate a keyword query which is passed to a
                semantic search engine. This embeds the query and compares it to
                chunks of code in vector space (we use Qdrant as our vector DB).
                We’ve found that using a semantic search engine for retrieval
                improves recall, allowing the LLM to retrieve code that doesn’t
                have any textual overlap with the query but is still relevant.
                Second, the retrieved code snippets are ranked and inserted into
                a final LLM prompt. We pass this to GPT-4 and its phenomenal
                understanding of code does the rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s work through an example. You start off by asking ‘Where is
                the query parsing logic?’ and then want to find out ‘Which
                library does it use?’. We use GPT-4 to generate the standalone
                keyword query: ‘query parser library’, which we then pass to a
                semantic search engine that returns a snippet demonstrating the
                parser in action: ‘let pair = PestParser::parse(Rule::query,
                query);’. We insert this snippet into a prompt to GPT-4, which
                is able to work out that pest is the library doing the legwork
                here, generating the answer ‘The query parser uses the pest
                library’.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also filter your search by repo or language - What’s the
                readiness delay repo:myApp lang:yaml. GPT-4 will generate an
                answer constrained to the respective repo and language.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also know that LLMs are not always (at least not yet) the
                best tool for the job. Sometimes you know exactly what you’re
                looking for. For this, we’ve built a fast, trigram index based
                regex search engine based on Tantivy. Because of this, bloop is
                fast at traditional search too. For code navigation, we’ve built
                a precise go-to-ref/def engine based on scope resolution that
                uses Tree-sitter.
              </p>
              <p>
                bloop is fully open-source. Semantic search, LLM prompts, regex
                search and code navigation are all contained in one repo:
                <a href="https://github.com/bloopAI/bloop"
                  >https://github.com/bloopAI/bloop</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our software is standalone and doesn’t run in your IDE. We were
                originally IDE-based but moved away from this due to constraints
                on how we could display code to the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                bloop runs as a free desktop app on Mac, Windows and Linux:
                <a href="https://github.com/bloopAI/bloop/releases"
                  >https://github.com/bloopAI/bloop/releases</a
                >. On desktop, your code is indexed with a MiniLM embedding
                model and stored locally, meaning at index time your codebase
                stays private. Indexing is fast, except on the very largest
                repos (GPU indexing coming soon). ‘Private’ here means that no
                code is shared with us or OpenAI at index time, and when a
                search is made only relevant code snippets are shared to
                generate the response. (This is more or less the same data usage
                as Copilot).
              </p>
              <p>
                We also have a paid cloud offering for teams ($12 per user per
                month). Members of the same organisation can search a shared
                index hosted by us.
              </p>

                We’d love to hear your thoughts about the product and where you
                think we should take it next, and your thoughts on code search
                in general. We look forward to your comments!

              <a href="https://lume.ai">https://lume.ai</a>). Lume uses AI to
              generate custom data integrations. We transform data between any
              start and end schema and pipe the data directly to your desired
              destination. There’s a demo video here:
              <a
                href="https://www.loom.com/share/bed137eb38884270a2619c71cebc1213"
                >https://www.loom.com/share/bed137eb38884270a2619c71cebc1213</a
              >.
              <p>
                Companies spend countless engineering hours manually
                transforming data for custom integrations, or pay large amounts
                to consulting firms to do it for them. Engineers have to work
                through massive data schemas and create hacky scripts to
                transform data. Dynamic schemas from different clients or apps
                require custom integration pipelines. Many non-tech companies
                are even still relying on schemas from csv and pdf file formats.
                Days, weeks, and even months are spent just building
                integrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                We ran into this problem first-hand as engineers: Nebyou during
                his time as a ML engineer at Opendoor, where he spent months
                manually creating data transformations, while Nicolas did the
                same at his time working at Apple Health. Talking to other
                engineers, we learned this problem was everywhere. Because of
                the dynamic and one-off nature of different data integrations,
                it has been a challenging problem to automate. We believe that
                with recent improvements in LLMs (large language models),
                automation has become feasible and now is the right time to
                tackle it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lume solves this problem head-on by generating data
                transformations, which makes the integration process 10x faster.
                This is provided through a self-serve managed platform where
                engineers can manage and create new data integrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                How it works: users can specify their data source and data
                destination, both of which specify the desired data formats,
                a.k.a. schemas. Data source and destinations can be specified
                through our 300+ app connectors, or custom data schemas can be
                connected by either providing access to your data warehouse, or
                a manual file upload (csv, json, etc) of your end schema. Lume,
                which includes AI and rule-based models, creates the desired
                transformation under the hood by drafting the necessary SQL
                code, and deploys it to your destination.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, engineers don’t want to rely on low- or
                no-code tools without visibility under the hood. Thus, we also
                provide features to ensure visibility, confidence, and
                editability of each integration: Data Preview allows you to view
                samples of the transformed data, SQL Editor allows you to see
                the SQL used to create the transformation and to change the
                assumptions made my Lume’s model, if needed (most of the time,
                you don’t!). In addition, Lineage Graph (launching soon) shows
                you the dependencies of your new integration, giving more
                visibility for maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our clients have two primary use cases. One common use case is
                to transform data source(s) into one unified ontology. For
                example, you can create a unified schema between Salesforce,
                Hubspot, Quickbooks, and Pipedrive in your data warehouse.
                Another common use case is to create data integrations between
                external apps, such as custom syncs between your SaaS apps. For
                example, you can create an integration directly between your CRM
                and BI tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most important thing about our solution is our generative
                system: our model ingests and understands your schemas, and uses
                that to generate transformations that map one schema to another.
                Other integration tools, such as Mulesoft and Informatica, ask
                users to manually map columns between schemas—which takes a long
                time. Data transformation tools such as dbt have improved the
                data engineering process significantly (we love dbt!) but still
                require extensive manual work to understand the data and to
                program. We abstract all of this and do all the transformations
                for our customers under the hood - which reduces the time taken
                to manually map and engineer these integrations from days/weeks
                to minutes. Our solution handles the truly dynamic nature of
                data integrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                We don’t have a public self-serve option yet (sorry!) because
                we’re at the early stage of working closely with specific
                customers to get their use cases into production. If you’re
                interested in becoming one of those, we’d love to hear from you
                at <a href="https://lume.ai">https://lume.ai</a>. Once the core
                feature set has stabilized, we’ll build out the public product.
                In the meantime, our demo video shows it in action:
                <a

              </p>
              <p>
                We currently charge a flat monthly fee that varies based on the
                quantity of data integrations. In the future, we plan on having
                more transparent pricing that’s made up of a fixed platform fee
                + compute-based charges. To not have surprise charges, we
                currently run the compute in your data warehouse.
              </p>
