            <div class="text">
              <p>
                My mother received a call from a scammer. They told her she
                needed to process some tax issue and prove that her bank account
                had enough money. In just a few minutes, they tricked her and
                manipulated her into entering banking OTP codes. All of her
                savings are now gone.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes this more dramatic is that last year I architected
                and helped a government department in my country build a big
                system. This system can track money flows across the whole
                country, to know where money comes from. I was very proud of
                this. It is the biggest achievement of my life. Even if nobody
                knows I built it, that was fine.
              </p>
              <p>
                But now I cannot protect my own mother. I cannot protect my
                family. My system can track the money, but it is almost
                impossible to get it back.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I went to the police, just in one small area, there were
                more than 20 cases in a single day. A hardworking student sent
                all their family's money, thinking it was for university fees or
                going abroad. An old factory worker lost all her retirement
                savings. So many people lost everything. That is when I realized
                that the system I built, the system I was proud of, is not
                enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                All my own savings are gone too. (My mother was scammed into
                borrowing a lot of money and sending it to the scammers, and now
                it is my responsibility.) I had plans for the next few years: to
                do open source work, to write books about math and programming,
                to create a dream Go web framework, to give back to the
                community. Now all of that is gone.
              </p>
              <p>
                But this is not only about me. I can still start over. I am
                strong enough to rebuild my life. But who will protect people
                like my mother? Or a poor student? Or a factory worker? Or so
                many others?
              </p>
              <p>
                I can build systems. I can build distributed systems that scale
                to a whole country. But for what? What should I do?
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been reading Hacker News for 12 to 13 years, sometimes
                posting from other accounts. I am writing here now to ask for
                advice and help from this community.
              </p>
              <p>
                If anyone has experience with similar cases, or ideas on what
                can realistically be done, or even advice on how to move forward
                after something like this, I would really appreciate it. I will
                keep this account semi-private, because with the details above,
                I think some engineers from my country may recognize me.

                First things, I want to thank all the people who work on the
                foundational crates and tools such as: -
                <a href="https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity"
                  >https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity</a

                  >https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit</a
                >
                - and many others
              </p>
              <p>
                When I started I had to learn what tools and examples already
                exist. Luckily, there's a good set of examples using both
                NativeActivity and GameActivity:
                <a href="https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples"
                  >https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The basic approach is that we take android-activity, winit and
                wgpu and that's it. On top of that you can find a few egui
                examples in the rust-android-examples repo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alright, so after I've got the basic examples running, I wanted
                to combine them with iced. Iced is a crossplatform gui library
                focusing on desktop and web. The mobile support is explicitly a
                non-goal, as far as I can tell at the moment of writing. Yet,
                there's an issue where some people posted their experiments.
                That's how I knew it was possible:
                <a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/302"
                  >https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/302</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a way to integrate iced in wgpu applications, so called
                integration example:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/0.14.0/examples/integration"
                  >https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/0.14.0/examples/integra...</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Above I mentioned that using winit and wgpu in combination with
                android-activity is enough to build the app. Putting together 1
                + 1 I got 2: let's use iced integration example with
                android-activity. It was quite easy to compile with almost no
                errors. First issue I encountered is that there was no text
                rendered. I solved this by loading fonts the way it was shown
                here:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/243#issue-2189977938"
                  >https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/243#issue-21899...</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I patched a few widgets to add touch support. And that's
                it. My role here was to take all the prior work and combine it
                together in a way that there's a working example.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some other ways of building Android apps using Rust: - xilem has
                an explicit goal to support mobile
                <a href="https://github.com/linebender/xilem"
                  >https://github.com/linebender/xilem</a
                >
                - egui supports mobile
                <a href="https://github.com/emilk/egui"
                  >https://github.com/emilk/egui</a
                >
                - game engines such as Fyrox and Bevy support mobile: -
                <a href="https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox"
                  >https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox</a
                >
                -
                <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy"
                  >https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy</a
                >
                - pretty much anything built on top of winit and wgpu
              </p>
              <p>
                All of the above is related to building native apps using either
                NativeActivity or GameActivity. I'm leaving webview out of scope
                of current post.
              </p>
              <p>
                What about iOS? As far as I know it should be similar or maybe
                simpler compared to Android. I haven't built it yet, but the
                next time I have a sizeable amount of free time, I'll try to
                make it work. The plan is the same: pick winit, wgpu, iced
                integration example, mix it together until it works. It'll
                require the same trick to load fonts, and maybe something else,
                but no visible blockers as of now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once again, thanks to all the people who made it possible and I
                wish you have a great time building mobile apps with Rust!

                Netrinos creates a LAN-like overlay network across your devices.
                Connections are direct P2P via WireGuard, with no central server
                routing traffic. Each device gets a stable IP and DNS name
                (pc.you.netrinos.com). When direct connections fail, they fall
                back to a relay server that's still encrypted end-to-end. We
                can't see your traffic.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most challenging problem to solve was NAT traversal. UDP
                hole punching works most of the time. The rest is a cocktail of
                symmetric NAT, CGNAT, and serial NATs. We use STUN-style
                discovery and relay fallback for the edge cases. I was surprised
                by how unreliable low-end ISP routers really are, and how much
                technical wizardry it takes to hide that behind a clean, simple
                UX.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our stack is a Go backend for client and server, WireGuard
                kernel mode for Linux and Windows (macOS is userspace), Wails.io
                for cross-platform UI. WireGuard does all the heavy lifting. Go
                ties it all together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Popular use cases include: RDP to home PCs, accessing NAS
                without exposing it, and SSH into headless Linux boxes. One
                customer manages hundreds of IoT devices in the field,
                eliminating the need to deal with customer routers.
              </p>

                We just released Pro with multi-user, access control, and remote
                gateway routing. Personal is free (up to 100 devices).

                I'd love to hear what you expect from a simple mesh VPN, what's
                missing from current tools, and what's lacking from your remote
                access setup. Use code HNPRO26 for a 30-day trial of Pro.
