                I run an ecom store that gets a lot of its customers from
                Twitter. I was also shocked to see my traffic double or triple
                overnight and thought the algorithm had blessed me and my
                business. Soon realized what was actually happening. Thought
                other traffic-monitors might appreciate this explanation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile Nikita Bier is pretending they never suppressed tweets
                with links to begin with, offering the alternative explanation:
                "a common complaint is that posts with links tend to get lower
                reach. This is because the web browser covers the post and
                people forget to Like or Reply. So X doesn't get a clear signal
                whether the content is any good"[1]. A bit of a rewriting of
                history since Elon and his mom both tweeted about how it wasn't
                fair to use his platform to promote other links/platforms, even
                banning people who shared profiles of other social networks
                (including Paul Graham for a period). They suppressed all links
                shortly after.

              <p>
                For quite some time, I've been unsatisfied with the built-in
                timers on both Android and iOS; especially for workouts, when I
                needed to set up a configurable number of series with rest
                periods in between. That's when I started thinking about
                building something myself. It was just a timer and I said to
                myself "how hard could it be?", I had no idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first iteration of the project worked "just fine", but the
                UI was an eyesore (even more than it is now), and the UX was
                quite awful as well. As you can probably guess, I'm not versed
                in design or front-end development. In fact, my last real
                experience with front-end work was back when jQuery was still a
                thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, I knew what I wanted to build, and over the last few
                days (and with the help of the infamous AI) I was able to wrap
                up the project for my needs. It required quite a lot of "hand
                holding" and "back and forth", but it helped me smooth out the
                rough edges and provided great suggestions about the latest ES6
                features.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is, as the title states, an offline-first PWA with
                zero dependencies; no build step, no cookies, no links, no
                analytics, nothing other than timers. It uses `Web Components`
                (a really nice feature, in my opinion, though I still don't get
                why we can't easily inherit styles from the global scope) and
                `localStorage` to save timers between uses.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd appreciate any comments or suggestions, since I just want to
                keep learning new things.
