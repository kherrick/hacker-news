                When learning foreign languages, I made the most progress by
                speaking them throughout the day, every day. So I made a site
                where you can *speak* to an AI language teacher to practice both
                listening and speaking.
              </p>
              <p># The product</p>
              <p>*What I have now:*</p>
              <p>
                * Multilingual speech recognition: You can ask a question in
                English and get an answer in your target language. * Feedback on
                your grammar. * Suggestions: See examples of what to say next to
                keep the conversation flowing. * Speed: Choose a lower speed for
                beginners or a faster one for advanced levels. * Translations:
                Click to see a translation into English (or another language). *
                Role-playing: Practice real-life situations. * Available to
                learn American English, British English, Australian English,
                French, Spanish from Spain, Spanish from Mexico, Brazilian
                Portuguese, European Portuguese, Russian, and more.
              </p>
              <p>*What I'd like to add:*</p>
              <p>
                * More Situations/Characters/Customizations: A "Creator mode". *
                Feedback on your pronunciation. * Text-based responses (Type or
                click – would feel like a "Create Your Own Adventure" book!) * A
                dictionary. * Phonetics: Zoom in and repeat a sound to help you
                hear phonemes and words more clearly. * …and so much more!…

              <p># The startup</p>
              <p>Been working on this for 6-7 months now.</p>
              <p>
                I love this project and got lots of laudatory comments about it,
                but still find it hard to make it take off. 31% of people come
                back to it, traffic is growing through word of mouth with
                language teachers in schools or Telegram or private intranets
                sharing it with others. So that's nice. But nice words alone
                don't pay the bills.
              </p>
              <p>
                My goal is to achieve enough growth to cover costs, which would
                then allow me to focus 100% on the product (currently it's more
                like 50% of my time). But I'm not there yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                A challenge I see is that most places forbid self-promotion. So
                I'm just not sure how on Earth I'm supposed to have a product
                take off. I could pay for ads, but I use AdBlock everywhere so
                this feels out of character. I'm a big fan of Pieter Levels
                (@levelsio on Twitter) because he's doing things solo, so I'm
                trying to emulate the same kind of success. But it seems that
                something is missing.
              </p>
              <p>
                What features would you find most useful? How can I better
                market this without resorting to ads?
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks for reading! If you've got thoughts or ideas, I would
                love to hear them.
              </p>
              <p>Cheers, Fabien</p>

              <p>Working backwards has its uses...</p>
              <p>
                I recently wanted validation on a product I had already finished
                developing
              </p>
              <p>
                I thought I needed it so others will too. I put in a lot of time
                architecting it, designing it with careful UX and UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it came time to show and tell through a demo video i
                couldn't create a simple enough one that explains what it does.
              </p>
              <p>
                So anyway I posted it in some communities and people we just
                confused and nobody signed up.
              </p>
              <p>So I had to abandon the project as there were no takers</p>
              <p>
                Cut to about a week back where I had another idea... This time
                instead of simply developing it further, I jumped straight to
                see if I can create a explainer video of the product. So with
                zero expectations about it working I made one without audio or
                music or even subtitles and posted on reddit. It was just a
                screen recording of it working on my laptop.
              </p>
              <p>
                To my surprise people wanted it. Some even demanding it. I
                quickly put up a "coming soon" website to capture emails. 36
                people gave their emails! Many more I could message on reddit
                once I am ready.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is the link to the reddit post...
                https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/13xm1s5/i_made_this_seo_keyword_searching_thingie_for_my/
              </p>
              <p>here is what I wrote...</p>
              <p>
                ------- Headline: I made this SEO keyword searching thingie for
                my own needs... Does anyone want it? Its very ugly at the moment
              </p>
              <p>
                Description: Lets say you want to rank high on Google for the
                keyword "pet dog care"
              </p>
              <p>
                Before you write any content, you want to know what questions
                people ask on Google, Who is ranking on the top 10 and what
                other keywords do they rank for?, and 'Google Suggestions' for
                the phrase.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I made one and I find it damn bloody useful when creating
                highly relevant and SEO potimised content. Wonder if anyone else
                finds this stuff useful.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been burnt building unnecessary stuff before so I am very
                careful to validate first now. I will only develop this further
                is there is any interest here :-) -------

              <p>
                Now I am developing the product into something others could use
                in collaboration with actual users and i have to do it fast
                since so many are waiting. This is a first for me. This is
                probably what product Market fit feels like... probably.

              <a href="https://castled.io">https://castled.io</a>). Castled is a
              Customer Engagement platform built directly on top of cloud data
              warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Postgres.
              <p>
                In essence, Castled is identical to Braze and Iterable with a
                crucial difference - we don't keep a copy of your customer data.
                Instead, we enable marketers to create audiences directly on
                their cloud data warehouse and engage them across channels like
                Email, Sms, WhatsApp, Push, and In-app notifications - no SQL
                knowledge, no engineering favours required.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is a quick demo:
                <a
                  href="https://www.loom.com/share/217a31ac47de451992573b1b37c1b8e5"
                  >https://www.loom.com/share/217a31ac47de451992573b1b37c1b8e5</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We started our journey by building an open-source Reverse ETL
                solution to make warehouse data actionable to marketers.
                However, after talking to 100s of marketers, we realised that
                modern B2C marketers needed to leverage billions of customer
                data points from the data warehouse to run personalised
                marketing campaigns. While Reverse ETL could sync all this data
                to marketing tools like Braze, Iterable, etc., the traditional
                marketing solutions were fundamentally not designed to store and
                process so much data.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when we changed course to build a warehouse-first
                customer engagement solution. With Castled, marketers could
                finally use "all" the data from their data warehouse to engage
                their customers without any tradeoffs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Customer Engagement platforms have historically been built on
                top of transactional databases. So, solving the same use cases
                on top of a data warehouse optimised for analytical workloads
                was a significant challenge. But fortunately, B2C marketing use
                cases primarily warranted bulk data access, which data
                warehouses were uniquely designed to solve. The architectural
                change also enabled us to offer capabilities that were
                impossible with traditional solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                As Castled is a "headless" platform - meaning we don't store any
                customer data - we offer a pricing model based solely on the
                number of team members using our platform, not the volume of
                data processed. The approach allowed our customers to focus on
                marketing efficiency without worrying about the fluctuating
                costs associated with data usage.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have been building Castled for more than a year and have
                enabled many businesses to overcome the data limitations of
                existing marketing platforms. If you have a data problem in

              <p>
                At our previous company, a student financing platform, we built
                several internal and external facing tools and encountered how
                tedious it can be to create and maintain myriads of APIs/CRUD
                operations. We especially felt that when building for edge cases
                and “what if” scenarios, as well as integrating with lots of
                third party services which receive, update and return data. In
                our case, a custom servicing platform which handled student
                repayments had to account for different student categories and
                repayment plans, while factoring in data we received from our
                KYC and ACH banking partners for each student. With Fastgen we
                try to eliminate boilerplate code and make it easier to adjust
                and share your work in a visual environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re low-code fans ourselves and believe it’s sometimes
                underappreciated how much complexity existing solutions can
                already handle, and we are excited to contribute to that market.
                The low-code space is crowded with front-end tools, but with a
                comparatively small number of backend tools. There is lots of
                busywork that comes with setting up a backend; we remove that
                busywork. Also, most low-code tools restrict users in what they
                are able to do. Our goal is to provide you with the flexibility
                and control inherent in coding, while still making it easier to
                use and faster to deploy.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Fastgen you sequence 'actions' to form rest APIs and
                workflows through a drag-and-drop interface. Actions are
                essentially functions that perform specific tasks such as
                sending an HTTP request, checking for conditions or interacting
                with a database.
              </p>
              <p>
                We support SQL for database operations, JSON for data structure,
                and comparison operators similar to JavaScript for
                decision-making in workflows. Everything you create can be
                deployed and tested instantly in the platform and will be hosted
                for you. Fastgen has a 'Debug Mode' that gives insights into the
                step-by-step execution of workflows. This aids in pinpointing
                issues and optimizing workflow performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                While some users have created backends for full MVPs with us,
                others use the platform to build automations for their
                data/operations teams. For example, one team was missing
                functionality in Pipedrive for their sales team, so they created
                a sequence of conditions and HTTP requests to the Pipedrive API
                to create their own custom lead recycling process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other things our users have done include the creation of KYC
                onboarding flows, a Chinese translation app using ChatGPT, an
                API that retrieves a company’s financial filings from the SEC
                for a crowdfunding platform, a cron job that checks for the
                health status of all other APIs in a code base, a categorizer of
                well performing product launches, a sitemap checker for a SEO
                project, and others.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would love for you to try out the platform and are excited
                for your thoughts and feedback in the comments!
