              <p>
                Flower lets you train ML models on data that is distributed
                across many user devices or “silos” (separate data sources)
                without having to move the data. This approach is called
                federated learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                A silo can be anything from a single user device to the data of
                an entire organization. For example, your smartphone keyboard
                suggestions and auto-corrections can be driven by a personalized
                ML model learned from your own private keyboard data, as well as
                data from other smartphone users, without the data being
                transferred from anyone’s device.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the famous AI breakthroughs — from ChatGPT and Google
                Translate to DALL·E and Stable Diffusion — were trained with
                public data from the web. When the data is all public, you can
                collect it in a central place for training. This “move the data
                to the computation” approach fails when the data is sensitive or
                distributed across organizational silos and user devices.
              </p>
              <p>Many important use cases are affected by this limitation:</p>
              <p>
                * Generative AI: Many scenarios require sensitive data that
                users or organizations are reluctant to upload to the cloud. For
                example, users might want to put themselves and friends into
                AI-generated images, but they don't want to upload and share all
                their photos.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Healthcare: We could potentially train cancer detection models
                better than any doctor, but no single organization has enough
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Finance: Preventing financial fraud is hard because individual
                banks are subject to data regulations, and in isolation, they
                don't have enough fraud cases to train good models.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Automotive: Autonomous driving would be awesome, but
                individual car makers struggle to gather the data to cover the
                long tail of possible edge cases.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Personal computing: Users don't want certain kinds of data to
                be stored in the cloud, hence the recent success of
                privacy-enhancing alternatives like the Signal messenger or the
                Brave browser. Federated methods open the door to using
                sensitive data from personal devices while maintaining user
                privacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Foundation models: These get better with more data, and more
                diverse data, to train them on. But again, most data is
                sensitive and thus can't be incorporated, even though these
                models continue to grow bigger and need more information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of us has worked on ML projects in various settings, (e.g.,
                corporate environments, open-source projects, research labs).
                We’ve worked on AI use cases for companies like Samsung,
                Microsoft, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz. One of our biggest
                challenges was getting the data to train AI while being
                compliant with regulations or company policies. Sometimes this
                was due to legal or organizational restrictions; other times, it
                was difficulties in physically moving large quantities of data
                or natural concerns over user privacy. Any of these problems can
                halt a ML project in its tracks.
              </p>
              <p>
                We realized issues of this kind were making it too difficult for
                many ML projects to get off the ground, and would especially
                impact certain domains like healthcare and finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Federated learning offers an alternative — it doesn't require
                moving data in order to train models on it, and so has the
                potential to overcome many barriers for ML projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                In early 2020, we began developing the open-source Flower
                framework to simplify federated learning and make it
                user-friendly. Last year, we experienced a surge in Flower's
                adoption among industry users, which led us to apply to YC. In
                the past, we funded our work through consulting projects, but
                looking ahead, we’re going to offer a managed version for
                enterprises and charge per deployment or federation. At the same
                time, we’ll continue to run Flower as an open-source project
                that everyone can continue to use and contribute to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Federated learning can train AI models on distributed and
                sensitive data by moving the training to the data instead of
                moving the data to the training. It collects whatever it can
                from the learning process, and the data stays where it is.
                Because the data never moves, we can train AI on sensitive data
                spread across organizational silos or user devices to improve
                models with data that could never be leveraged until now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s how it works: (0) Initialize the global model parameters
                on the server; (1) Send the model parameters to a number of
                organizations/devices (client nodes); (2) Train model locally on
                the data of each organization/device (client node); (3) Return
                the updated model parameters back to the server; (4) On the
                server, aggregate the model updates (e.g., by averaging them)
                into a new global model; (5): Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the
                model converges.
              </p>
              <p>
                This, of course, is more challenging than centralized learning:
                we must move AI models to data silos or user devices, train
                locally, send updated models back, aggregate them, and repeat.
                Flower provides the open-source infrastructure to easily do
                this, as well as supporting other privacy-enhancing technologies
                (PETs). It is compatible with PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Hugging
                Face, Fastai, Weights &amp; Biases and all the other tools used
                in ML projects regularly. The only dependency on the server side
                is NumPy, but even that can be dropped if necessary. Flower uses
                gRPC under the hood, so a basic client can easily be
                auto-generated, even for most languages that are not supported
                today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Flower is open-source (Apache 2.0 license) and can be run in all
                kinds of environments: on a personal workstation for development
                and simulation, on Google Colab, on a compute cluster for
                large-scale simulations or on a cluster of Raspberry Pi’s (or
                similar devices) to build research systems, or deployed on
                public cloud instances (AWS, Azure, GCP, others) or private
                on-prem hardware. We are happy to help users when deploying
                Flower systems and will soon make this even easier through our
                managed cloud service.

              <a href="https://www.frigade.com">https://www.frigade.com</a>), a
              developer tool for building high-quality product onboarding.
              Here’s a demo video:
              <a href="https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4"
                >https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4</a

              <p>
                Onboarding is a critical first experience for software products.
                It makes a big difference for customer activation and retention.
                However, onboarding experiences often do not get the attention
                they deserve because, without good tooling, they’re a pain to
                build. At a previous startup, Christian and I were surprised at
                how hard it was to get right. It took a ton of time that would
                otherwise have gone to our core product. We also knew that much
                better tooling was possible because we had experienced it in the
                internal tooling at LinkedIn, where we worked at a previous job.
              </p>
              <p>
                Established software companies such as LinkedIn, Uber, Vanta,
                and many others invest in internal developer platforms to give
                their teams advantages like the ability to quickly build great
                onboarding experiences. But these platforms only get built at
                scale. With Frigade, our goal is to develop the platform that
                every growth engineering team would love to have, but can’t
                afford to build themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are no-code tools for onboarding (e.g. Pendo, Appcues,
                Intercom), but they’re rigid and clumsy. They’re built for
                marketers and managers rather than developers, so they sit on
                top of your product instead of feeling native. They’re not
                defined in your codebase, frequently break without teams
                noticing, and there are limits to what you can build with them.
                Unlike these tools, Frigade uses native SDKs and provides an API
                for developers to build new onboardings in code.
              </p>
              <p>
                How to use Frigade in your product: first install our SDK (React
                for now); choose a production-ready Frigade UI component or go
                headless; create a “Frigade Flow” in our admin panel and hook it
                up to the SDK (Flows are where you set the logic, targeting,
                content, and more); publish your flow to go live.
              </p>
              <p>
                Frigade automatically tracks users’ progress through your Flows.
                Your team can sign in to our admin panel to see which customers
                have completed what steps or input data, and you can use our API
                to sync tracking events to your analytics platform, send drip
                campaign (emails that guide users through setup), or show
                product reminders (e.g. “Finish connecting your data” banners).
                Frigade leverages server-driven UI, so once a Flow is live, you
                can easily update content (e.g. change copy, add another step)
                and logic (e.g. who should see it and when) in real-time without
                new code deploys.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve spent most of our time building out the platform with
                early customers so far, but our self-serve flow is (ironically)
                coming soon. In the meantime, our demo video gives you the basic
                picture:

                  >https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4</a
                >. Please let us know if you’re interested in trying Frigade,
                we’d love to get your feedback on what we’ve built so far! We
                work mostly with web-based B2B companies today, and our pricing
                is competitive with other tools on the market.
              </p>
              <p>
                What has been your experience with product onboarding? We’d love
                to hear more about what’s worked well and what’s been a pain in
                the ass—as well as anything else you’d like to share.
