                We’re sharing some of the challenges we faced building an AI
                video interface that has realistic conversations with a human,
                including getting it to under 1 second of latency.
              </p>
              <p>
                To try it, talk to Hassaan’s digital twin:
                <a href="https://www.hassaanraza.com"
                  >https://www.hassaanraza.com</a
                >, or to our "demo twin" Carter:
                <a href="https://www.tavus.io">https://www.tavus.io</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                We built this because until now, we've had to adapt
                communication to the limits of technology. But what if we could
                interact naturally with a computer? Conversational video makes
                it possible – we think it'll eventually be a key human-computer
                interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make conversational video effective, it has to have really
                low latency and conversational awareness. A fast-paced
                conversation between friends has ~250 ms between utterances, but
                if you’re talking about something more complex or with someone
                new, there is additional “thinking” time. So, less than 1000 ms
                latency makes the conversation feel pretty realistic, and that
                became our target.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our architecture decisions had to balance 3 things: latency,
                scale, &amp; cost. Getting all of these was a huge challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first lesson learned was to make it low-latency, we had to
                build it from the ground up. We went from a team that cared
                about seconds to a team that counts every millisecond. We also
                had to support thousands of conversations happening all at once,
                without getting destroyed on compute costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, during early development, each conversation had to
                run on an individual H100 in order to fit all components and
                model weights into GPU memory just to run our Phoenix-1 model
                faster than 30fps. This was unscalable &amp; expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                We developed a new model, Phoenix-2, with a number of
                improvements, including inference speed. We switched from a NeRF
                based backbone to Gaussian Splatting for a multitude of reasons,
                one being the requirement that we could generate frames faster
                than realtime, at 70+ fps on lower-end hardware. We exceeded
                this and focused on optimizing memory and core usage on GPU to
                allow for lower-end hardware to run it all. We did other things
                to save on time and cost like using streaming vs batching,
                parallelizing processes, etc. But those are stories for another
                day.
              </p>
              <p>
                We still had to lower the utterance-to-utterance time to hit our
                goal of under a second of latency. This meant each component
                (vision, ASR, LLM, TTS, video generation) had to be
                hyper-optimized.
              </p>
              <p>
                The worst offender was the LLM. It didn’t matter how fast the
                tokens per second (t/s) were, it was the time-to-first token
                (tfft) that really made the difference. That meant services like
                Groq were actually too slow – they had high t/s, but slow ttft.
                Most providers were too slow.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next worst offender was actually detecting when someone
                stopped speaking. This is hard. Basic solutions use time after
                silence to ‘determine’ when someone has stopped talking. But it
                adds latency. If you tune it to be too short, the AI agent will
                talk over you. Too long, and it’ll take a while to respond. The
                model had to be dedicated to accurately detecting end-of-turn
                based on conversation signals, and speculating on inputs to get
                a head start.
              </p>
              <p>
                We went from 3-5 to &lt;1 second (&amp; as fast as 600 ms) with
                these architectural optimizations while running on lower-end
                hardware.
              </p>
              <p>
                All this allowed us to ship with a less than 1 second of
                latency, which we believe is the fastest out there. We have a
                bunch of customers, including Delphi, a professional coach and
                expert cloning platform. They have users that have conversations
                with digital twins that span from minutes, to one hour, to even
                four hours (!) - which is mind blowing, even to us.

                This still generates the "data" using that rust library via
                wasm, but the rendering is all editable javascript to make an
                SVG or paint on an HTML canvas.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I run a successful tech business and I also consult others who
                want to start their own businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now this is a problem I'm seeing other tech CEOs start doing
                which is use AI to have the code written for them by either
                using some sort of editor plugin or by using something like
                Cursor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem is that the code that is generated is usually
                humongous. There is just huge amounts of types and indirection
                and functions, calling functions and doing all sorts of nonsense
                which can be done manually, much simpler with fewer lines of
                code.
              </p>
              <p>This is creating huge amounts of AI-generated slop.</p>
              <p>
                Now when I come in to consult some of these tech architectures
                it takes me a really long time to figure out how to improve
                things because there is so much of indirection in the code base
                and the more troubling thing is that there are errors hidden in
                the architecture which earlier I would easily find out, but now
                it requires me to go through every single line of code.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some of the worst cases, there have been bugs which have
                taken down their system and then they come and blame me for not
                being able to find it.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the same problem that I had with Java shops. A lot of
                Java programmers immediately start using a lot of classes and
                objects because they had for a very long time superior tooling
                and IDEs.
              </p>
              <p>
                My theory is that Java is actually a pretty reasonable good
                language but because there is such easy tooling and easy
                autocomplete you can almost always increase the huge web of
                classes and objects because you can immediately reach for them
                by pressing a dot.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now take that and increase it like 10x with all of this AI
                generated code. The medium is what influences what the code
                generated or written is.
              </p>
              <p>
                So how are you all handling this problem? Do you find this to be
                a big problem in the code bases that you see?
              </p>
              <p>
                It's also hard to tell them not to use AI because the code does
                work. I would say even most of the times the code does work.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it's just written in the worst possible manner and
                maintaining it long term is going to be so much harder if
                instead they had just handwritten the code.
