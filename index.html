                I wanted to share something we at Good Enough (<a
                  href="https://goodenough.us"
                  >https://goodenough.us</a
                >) built over the past year:
              </p>
              <p>
                Jelly! <a href="https://letsjelly.com">https://letsjelly.com</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Jelly is a simpler shared inbox for small teams (like us) to
                answer team email. We had just been sharing a login to Fastmail
                previously, but as email started getting busier, that really
                started to stink as a solution — no one knew who was going to
                answer what, if someone else saw an email or not, etc etc. And a
                Google Group would prove to be worse, as replies too easily got
                lost to personal inboxes if someone accidentally didn’t “Reply
                All”. It wasn’t great!
              </p>
              <p>
                We went looking for a tool to solve these problems, but
                everything we found was way too much software, and really quite
                expensive charging per seat. We didn’t need a complex ticketing
                system. We just needed email, as a team, in a simple and sane
                way.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we built Jelly! And we’re not charging per seat, so you can
                bring your whole team for a very affordable price. (As a quick
                comparison for our team of six: Jelly’s lowest tier costs just
                $29/month while Zendesk’s costs upwards of $330/month.)
              </p>
              <p>
                We would love to hear thoughts from anyone on a small team that
                needs to handle shared email. Also, if you know of other teams
                in that same position, we’d appreciate you letting them know
                about Jelly. Thank you!

              <p>
                Over the past year we've seen a ton of excitement in companies
                adopting Clickhouse-based observability stacks - but one of the
                biggest challenges we've seen is that the UI layer on top of
                Clickhouse is either clunky to use for observability use cases
                (ex. BI tools), or too tied to a specific ingestion architecture
                to scale to every use case (we used to be in this category!).
                For companies that needed more flexibility in how their data is
                ingested and stored (usually due to running at a large scale),
                there's really no good options for a developer experience (DX)
                focused observability layer on top of Clickhouse (Shopify spent
                3 years building it in-house!)
              </p>
              <p>
                Our current release works completely in the browser - and it
                does this by building on top of Clickhouse's HTTP interface,
                which our React app can directly talk to. This means you can
                actually try HyperDX in your browser on your own Clickhouse with
                no installation! This was fortunately easy for us to accomplish
                due to being full stack Typescript, making it incredibly easy to
                shift between server and client code. On top of this we've been
                spending time baking in performance optimizations to ensure that
                HyperDX can continue to leverage Clickhouse efficiently at
                larger data volumes. We do a few tricks like only fetching
                columns that are needed for the current search, and re-querying
                to expand the entire row if needed to fully leverage
                Clickhouse's columnar nature (40% faster, ymmv!) - or rewriting
                queries to use materialized columns to speed up Map column
                access when available (10x faster!).
              </p>
              <p>
                On the DX side: we support querying using both Lucene (ex.
                `fullText property:value`) and SQL syntax. We've found the
                former to be our favorite for how concise it is. Similarly for
                charts, our chart builder has been upgraded to accept SQL
                expressions as well, so you can leverage the full power of SQL,
                while avoiding typing paragraphs of boilerplate SQL for time
                series data. We also make it easy to switch between UTC/local
                timestamps! Lastly, we've added high cardinality outlier
                analysis by charting the delta between outlier and inlier events
                (a la bubble up) - which we've found really helpful in narrowing
                down causes of regressions/anomalies in our traces.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a lot more planned for the full release - but wanted to
                get this out early to hear your feedback and opinions!

                Instant is (a) a really hard problem (b) that users want (c)
                worked on by an excellent team (d) where you can have immense
                impact and (e) be compensated accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>Let me explain:</p>
              <p>## (a) a really hard problem</p>
              <p>
                For the last two years, we’ve been hacking on Instant, the
                modern Firebase. Instant is a database you can use directly from
                the browser; you write queries, and they stay in sync, work
                offline, and come with optimistic updates out of the box. You
                get auth, and a system for running permissions too. You also
                have support for presence, and SDKs for React, vanilla JS, and
                React Native.
              </p>
              <p>
                For years we were in a cave building and talking to a core group
                of users; Instant turned out to be one of the hardest products
                we’ve ever worked on. We built a multi-tenant architecture, so
                we could offer a free tier that never freezes (you can even spin
                up a database without signing up, check out the tutorial [1]. We
                had to write a query engine on the backend, and a sync layer on
                top of that. To do it, we scoured articles on Figma’s LiveGraph,
                Asana’s Luna, and Andy Pavlo’s courses.
              </p>
              <p>
                We open sourced last month, and had one of the largest Show HN’s
                for a YC company [2]. And soon after that, we announced a 3.4M
                seed round, backed by James Tamplin (the founder of Firebase),
                Paul Graham, Greg Brockman, Jeff Dean, Amjad Masad, Karri
                Saarinen, and 50+ technical angels.
              </p>
              <p>## (b) that users want</p>
              <p>
                Since launch, we have been flooded with user requests. Some of
                the largest infra and AI companies have reached out to us for
                integrations. We have people asking for enterprise deals, and
                had to turn some down due to bandwidth.
              </p>
              <p>
                You probably resonate yourself — you know how much of a schlep
                software development can be: spin up databases, write endpoints,
                funnel data to store, and finally paint screens. You do all of
                that, and the app is just ok. If you want to make it great, time
                to add reactivity, optimistic updates, and offline mode.
              </p>
              <p>
                It doesn’t have to be this hard. There’s a missing abstraction,
                and it looks like a database you can use in the browser.
                Companies like Figma, Asana, Linear, and Notion have all built
                this internally. It’s obvious to us that most apps will be built
                this way in the future, and we built Instant to power them.
              </p>
              <p>## (c) worked on by an excellent team</p>
              <p>
                For the longest time, we’ve been a very small team: right now
                it’s just 3 of us: Joe Averbukh, Daniel Woelfel, and me. We’ve
                known each-other for 10 years, and have worked across companies
                together. We think small teams of very talented people are
                special; It’s more fun, you get more autonomy, and you form
                relationships for life.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is how it feels at Instant. Each of us own projects that
                would have deserved large infrastructure orgs at other
                companies. Each of us takes our craft and our word seriously;
                it’s a breath of fresh air to work together, knowing that when
                you ask for help, you have someone who you deeply respect by
                your side.
              </p>
              <p>## (d) where you can have immense impact</p>
              <p>
                Our current architecture got us to a new stage, but to really
                excel at this next stage, there’s <i>a lot more</i> to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                We recently had to turn down 2 customers because they would have
                added 2 magnitudes more traffic. Our infrastructure can’t handle
                that yet, but perhaps with your help, they will. Maybe you could
                dive deep into our sync engine: what kind of algorithms can we
                write to improve invalidation? How can we jig postgres to make
                queries even faster? How can we send less data to the client?
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a storage service in beta. We want to make it the best
                one on the market. We want files to live in your database too,
                so they can be reactive, and work with permissions out of the
                box. You shouldn’t have to deal with presigned URLs. You
                shouldn’t need triggers to sync different datastores. You should
                just be able to upload files from the client.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a multi-tenant database you can start with, but what
                about existing companies? They already use Postgres. Well, what
                if we created a Postgres adapter for Instant? We could take
                Instant queries and translated them to postgres SQL. What kind
                of [postgres introspection queries](<a
                  href="https://github.com/instantdb/instant/blob/main/server/src/instant/db/pg_introspect.clj#L28"
                  >https://github.com/instantdb/instant/blob/main/server/src/in...</a
                >) would you need to write to infer the schema?
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now we have no story for load testing. We want to build a
                suite to track metrics to track perf and have visibility on
                improvements/degradation. Even something akin to the one-laptop
                solution [4] Figma had up to 2020 would be a big win for us. Can
                you build it?
              </p>
              <p>
                Or how about our client side SDK. Our reactive layer on the
                client is a state machine, and it’s getting out of control.
                Maybe it’s time to introduce observables. Can you add them? We
                should be able to introspect into the state of the client: what
                happens when you make a transaction? Can we see it propagate and
                change throughout the SDK?
              </p>
              <p>## (e) be compensated accordingly</p>
              <p>
                If this was a few months ago, I would not have written this, I
                didn’t think the risk/reward would be worth it for you. But at
                this point, I really think it is. We’re just at the point where
                we could hit PMF with your help, and since we haven’t raised an
                A yet, we can offer you significant equity to make it happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re the kind of person who gets excited about this stuff,
                who truly loves their craft, and wants to work with others who
                do, who moves fast, but isn’t afraid to look deep into the
                ‘scarier’ programming problems. we want to talk to you.
