                Watch this video if you're interested into the different scales
                of cheats that can be used, pretty much undetectable:
                <a

              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, Valve does not seem to have a viable solution for
                dealing with cheaters nor are they transparent about their
                intentions (I'm sure for good reason). I can only imagine the
                complexities they have to deal with, and at the same time there
                is a potential negative monetary impact. Valve makes boat loads
                of $$ from Counter-Strike through skins for weapons and models.
                It is its own economy. Banning people, even though they are
                cheaters, is money lost.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, some of the solutions to deal with cheaters are to
                play on 3rd party services (i.e. FACEIT) that require you to
                install an "anti-cheat" that gives kernel level access and is
                owned by some questionable folks (I won't get into the details
                of that you can do your own research).
              </p>
              <p>
                That brings us to GamingHerd. For now, my idea is to be Google
                for PC video game cheaters, smurfs (read this about smurfs

                video games with. Let me tell you, there are a lot,
                unfortunately.

                Currently, I am working to grow this into a community and build
                a matchmaking service around it. The matchmaking would obviously
                utilize the Toxic Gaming DB (TGDB) to never allow them to use
                the service. I'll also have community-driven moderation, you can

                About a year ago my wife and I, both closing in on 40, quit our
                jobs at Red Hat to start a games company and learn game
                development. Many things happened along the road, and about a
                week ago we released our first (small) game on Steam.
              </p>

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The demo is free to play up to level 8 (the final game plays up
                to level 80) and we'd appreciate any feedback you have, whether
                it's for the store page or the game itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                We made the game in Godot 4.2 in roughly 3 months and I was
                working full time next to it. Since we ran into a bunch of
                roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up
                as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the
                game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The
                only thing we can't redistribute with the game code is the
                Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam. (The
                game minus integration is fully runnable without the SDK,
                though.)

              The Recovery Kit 2 is another cyberdeck that for me is part
              computer, part backup device, and part functional movie prop. It's
              been fun to build, and the HN community has been great with ideas-
              especially around hosting and getting me off Squarespace. I hope

              <p>
                At a company I worked for, we needed to develop an MVP
                (basically a web page) and apply certain business logic to a
                Google Drive spreadsheet that was frequently updated by the
                Sales team.
              </p>
              <p>In this case, we had two options:</p>
              <p>
                Develop a backend to replace the current spreadsheet and have
                the sales team use it as a new "backoffice" - This would take a
                very long time, and if the hypothesis we were testing was wrong,
                it would be time wasted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create the web page and use Google's SDK to extract data from
                the spreadsheet.
              </p>
              <p>
                We chose to go with the second option because it was quicker.
                Indeed, it was much faster than creating a new backoffice. But
                not as quick as we imagined. Integrating with Google's SDK
                requires some effort, especially to handle the OAuth logic,
                configure it in the console, and understand the documentation
                (which is quite shallow, by the way).
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway! We did the project and I realized that maybe other devs
                might have encountered similar issues. Therefore, I developed a
                tool that transforms Google spreadsheets into "realtime APIs"
                with PATCH, GET, POST, and DELETE methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since it's a product for devs, I think it would be cool to hear
                your opinions. It's still quite primitive, but the basic
                features already work.

                moved by curiosity about how to build an autonomous agent, and
                to explore the boundaries of machine creativity, I built a
                fictional entity (dubbed Livia) powered by LLMs, Multimodal
                models and text-to-image models to find some answers.
              </p>
              <p>
                What happened instead is that more questions have cropped up. An
                important hypothesis of this project is that, by observing the
                train of thought and witnessing the simulated state of mind and
                emotional emulation surrounding it, humans could empathize with
                a machine. What happens when that's the case? Would people enjoy
                companionship from a synthetic person? Would the Art
                establishment ever consider a non-human author (capable of
                making art and interacting with other humans) an Artist?
              </p>
              <p>
                Whatever the answers, I can't shake away the feeling that human
                uniqueness is being eroded and that we risk facing a crisis of
                meaning. Perhaps projects such as this help us demonize those
                fears, similarly to how sci-fi does, even though the boundary
                between fiction and reality is blurring.

                I am aware there are already libraries that can draw to multiple
                contexts interchangeably, but I've added a few little niceties
                to Ripl that (as far as I know) some other libraries don't have
                such as CSS-like query selectors, DOM-like event bubbling, and
                keyframe animation support.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is far from done and not published to NPM yet, but
                there are a few demos and source that you can look at in the
                repo.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm happy with how it has come along and the things I've learnt
                along the way, especially the math. My dream would be to one day
                work on this full-time and build out a full data-viz library.

                I‚Äôm excited to introduce ClassroomIO ‚Äì a project that I‚Äôve been
                working on for the past few months. It‚Äôs an educational platform
                that provides an in-browser code editor and execution
                environment. The idea is to make teaching programming easier by
                eliminating the technical barriers that educators and students
                often face.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feature highlights: * In-Browser coding: Write, run, and debug
                code directly in your browser. No more downloading software,
                configuring environments, and resolving compatibility issues. *
                Course management: Manage classes, assignments, and student
                interactions in one place. * Many languages supported: Python,
                Java, JavaScript, C/C++, C#, Go, PHP ‚Äì more incoming.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open beta access: I‚Äôd love it if interested people could join my
                open beta, explore the platform's capabilities, and provide some
                feedback to help me make it a better tool.
              </p>
              <p>Thank you for your time!</p>
