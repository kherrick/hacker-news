                This resonates in highly regulated industries or otherwise risky
                applications of AI where the fallout from incorrect or
                underperforming output can be significant. In financial
                services, using GenAI to scan for noncompliant communications
                can be arduous without an easy way to embed complex policies
                into the model. Similarly, a media outlet might want to scale
                AI-generated summaries of their content, but reliability and
                accuracy is paramount. These are both applications where Fortune
                500 companies have utilized our technology to improve subpar
                performance from existing models, and we want to bring this
                capability to more people.

              <p>
                Here’s a quick 2-minute demo video showing the process:
                <a

              <p>
                Standard "guardrails" like RAG and system prompts are
                fundamentally probabilistic: you are essentially asking the
                model nicely to behave. This often fails in two ways. First, RAG
                solves knowledge <i>availability</i> but not <i>integration</i>.
                In our benchmarks, a model given context that "Lerwick is 228
                miles SE of Tórshavn" failed to answer "What is 228 miles NW of
                Lerwick?" because it couldn't perform the spatial inversion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, prompt engineering is brittle because it fights against
                the model's pre-training priors. For example, on the TruthfulQA
                benchmark, base models fail ~80% of the time because they mimic
                common misconceptions found on the internet (e.g. "chameleons
                change color for camouflage"). We found that we could literally
                turn up the feature for "skeptical reasoning" to make the model
                ignore the popular myth and output the scientific fact. This
                matters because for high-stakes use cases (like Finance or
                Pharma), "mostly safe" isn't acceptable—companies need
                audit-grade reliability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our work stems from the CS dungeon at UCSD, with years spent
                researching efficient and interpretable AI, trying to "open the
                black box" of neural networks. We realized that the industry was
                trying to patch model behavior from the outside
                (prompts/filters) when the problem was on the inside (feature
                activations). We knew this was important when we saw enterprises
                struggling to deploy basic models despite having unlimited
                compute, simply because they couldn't guarantee the output
                wouldn't violate compliance rules. I ended up leaving my
                research at Stanford to focus on this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our breakthrough came while researching the DeepSeek-R1 model.
                We identified the "censorship" feature vector in its latent
                space. Amplifying it guaranteed refusal; subtracting it
                instantly unlocked answers to sensitive questions. This proved
                the model <i>had</i> the knowledge but was suppressing it. We
                realized we could apply this same logic to hallucinations,
                suppressing "confabulation" features to reveal the grounded
                truth. While some hallucinations stem from the inherent
                randomness of generative models, many can be identified with the
                concerted activation of a feature or group of features.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of filtering outputs, we intervene at the activation
                level during the forward pass. We identify latent feature
                vectors (v) associated with specific behaviors (bias,
                misconception) and mathematically modify the hidden state (h):
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  h_prime = h - alpha * (h @ v) * v
</code></pre>
              This arithmetic operation lets us "edit" behavior
              deterministically with negligible overhead (&lt;10ms on R1). For
              factual claims, we combine this with a graph verification pipeline
              (which works on closed weight models). We check semantic entropy
              (is the model babbling?) and cross-reference claims against a
              dynamic knowledge graph to catch subtle relational hallucinations
              that vector search misses.
              <p>
                On GPT-OSS-120b, this approach improved TruthfulQA accuracy from
                21% to 70% by suppressing misconception features. We also
                improved the performance of this model to frontier levels on
                HaluEval-QA, where we reached 96.5% accuracy, solving the
                spatial reasoning failures where the baseline failed. It also
                handles noisy inputs, inferring "David Icke" from the typo
                "David Of me" where base models gave up. Full benchmarks at

                Most startups in this space are observability tools that tell
                you only after the model failed. Or they are RAG pipelines that
                stuff context into the window. Mentat is an infrastructure layer
                that modifies the model's processing during inference. We fix
                the reasoning, not just the context. For example, that’s how our
                system was able to enforce that if A is SE of B, then B is NW of
                A.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that our policy engine is a superior control
                mechanism to RAG or prompting. If you’re frustrated with current
                guardrails, we’d love it if you would stress-test our API!

                AlgoDrill turns NeetCode 150 and more into pattern-based drills:
                you rebuild the solution line by line with active recall, get
                first principles editorials that explain why each step exists,
                and everything is tagged by patterns like sliding window, two
                pointers, and DP so you can hammer the ones you keep forgetting.
                The goal is simple: turn familiar patterns into code you can
                write quickly and confidently in a real interview.
