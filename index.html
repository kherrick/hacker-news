                Every year, we ask thousands of readers (and authors) to share
                their 3 favorite reads of the year.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now you can enter a book/author you love and see what books
                readers loved who also loved that book/author.
              </p>

                This goes wide and doesn't try to limit itself to the genre, so
                you get some interesting results.

              <p>What do you think?</p>
              <p>Background:</p>
              <p>
                I want better recommendations based on my reading history. I'm
                incredibly frustrated with what is out there.
              </p>
              <p>
                This system is based on 5,000 readers voting on their 3 favorite
                reads from 2023 to 2025. So, this covers ~15,000 books and is a
                high-quality vote. We wanted to keep the dataset small for now
                while we play with approaches.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are building a full Book DNA app that pulls in your Goodreads
                history and delivers deeply personalized book recommendations
                based on people who like similar books (a significant
                challenge).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can sign up to beta test it here if you want to help me with
                that:

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The first beta is coming out in late January, but it's pretty
                basic to start.

              <p>
                Z80-μLM is a character-level language model with 2-bit quantized
                weights ({-2,-1,0,+1}) that runs on a Z80 with 64KB RAM. The
                entire thing: inference, weights, chat UI, it all fits in a 40KB
                .COM file that you can run in a CP/M emulator and hopefully even
                real hardware!
              </p>
              <p>
                It won't write your emails, but it can be trained to play a
                stripped down version of 20 Questions, and is sometimes able to
                maintain the illusion of having simple but terse conversations
                with a distinct personality.
              </p>
              <p>--</p>
              <p>
                The extreme constraints nerd-sniped me and forced interesting
                trade-offs: trigram hashing (typo-tolerant, loses word order),
                16-bit integer math, and some careful massaging of the training
                data meant I could keep the examples 'interesting'.
              </p>
              <p>
                The key was quantization-aware training that accurately models
                the inference code limitations. The training loop runs both
                float and integer-quantized forward passes in parallel, scoring
                the model on how well its knowledge survives quantization. The
                weights are progressively pushed toward the 2-bit grid using
                straight-through estimators, with overflow penalties matching
                the Z80's 16-bit accumulator limits. By the end of training, the
                model has already adapted to its constraints, so no post-hoc
                quantization collapse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually I ended up spending a few dollars on Claude API to
                generate 20 questions data (see examples/guess/GUESS.COM), I
                hope Anthropic won't send me a C&amp;D for distilling their
                model against the ToS ;P
              </p>
              <p>But anyway, happy code-golf season everybody :)</p>

                Sadly, it currently does not have its own index but rather uses
                the Brave search API. Once I'm in a financial position that it's
                possible, I would absolutely love to build a completely new
                index from the ground up which is open source, as well as an
                open source ranking and search algorithm, to back it.
              </p>

                I posted on Reddit and got an amazing amount of feedback which I
                implemented a number of feature requests, so I would really like
                your ideas, critiques, and bug reports as well. Thank you and
                sorry for the long post!
