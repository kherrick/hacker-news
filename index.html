                ML Blocks is a node-based workflow builder to create multi-modal
                AI workflows without writing any code.
              </p>
              <p>
                You connect blocks that call various visual models like GPT4v,
                Segment Anything, Dino etc. along with basic image processing
                blocks like resize, invert color, blur, crop, and several
                others.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea is to make it easier to deploy multi-step image
                processing workflows, without needing to spin up endless custom
                OpenCV cloud functions to glue together AI models. Usually, even
                if you're using cloud inference servers like Replicate, you
                still need to write your own image processing code to pre and
                post-process images in your pipeline. When you're trying to move
                fast, that's just unnecessary overhead.
              </p>
              <p>
                With ML Blocks, you can build a workflow and deploy the whole
                thing as a single API. AFAIK, ML Blocks is the only end-to-end
                workflow builder built specifically for image processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're curious, our models run on Replicate, HuggingFace
                &amp; Modal Labs cloud GPUs and we use React Flow for the node
                UX.

                Typical modern large orgs have hundreds if not thousands of
                APIs, and many of those handle sensitive data or are critical to
                business operations. The development of those APIs is
                distributed across different development teams that donâ€™t always
                have knowledge of API security best practices. API source codes
                are updated frequently, making it easy for new, easily
                exploitable security vulnerabilities to be introduced in
                production environments (think the 2018 FB 50M accounts data
                leak).
              </p>
              <p>
                APIs make up 80% of global web traffic, and this share is
                growing. The responsibility for securing APIs is usually given
                to the organization's security engineers, not the API
                developers, which makes sense because theyâ€™re the ones who know
                how to secure things. But in practice, it is almost an
                impossible job because the security engineers have no way to
                track everything the developers are exposing online, and
                usually, thereâ€™s nobody to tell them! And when they do find out,
                they lack the right tooling for achieving it. This is a huge
                risk for organizations, a pain and personal risk for security
                engineers, and a great technical challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working as a software engineer a few years back, I faced a data
                scare: a pharmaceutical client's data was compromised due to a
                NoSQL injection. In this case the damage ended up controlled,
                but it led to the nightmarish thought of waking up one day with
                all the data from the applications gone, simply because
                cybercriminals exploited a security issue. When looking for
                solutions that allowed developers to ensure what they released
                in production was secure, we couldnâ€™t find anything particularly
                good. Security scanning tools like OWASP ZAP had been designed
                for people with penetration testing backgrounds. Code scanning
                tools were only finding the low-hanging fruit at the cost of
                many false positives, and ended up resembling security-oriented
                linters, turning the entire IDE red for minimal value. It felt
                like none of the existing security tools were built with real
                engineers in mind. When I met Antoine, who had previously been a
                security engineer at NATO and Apple, we decided to tackle this
                issue together and create a modern security tool that would
                appeal to both developers and security people. It needed to be
                fast, easy to set up yet configurable, have outstanding support
                for securing APIs, and find what was relevant with a low false
                positive rate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first step was to show security engineers and developers
                what APIs they had to secure. We needed to find an easy way to
                discover any organizationâ€™s exposed and internal APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                To discover all APIs, we crafted a system that extracts all the
                API routes the organization exposes by scanning its domains,
                frontend websites, and SPAs. It then enriches this data by
                connecting to code repositories, API gateways, and API
                development tools to create a full list of all the exposed
                endpoints and the sensitivity of the data they handle. Other
                testing tools do not provide an inventory of all the API routes
                exposed by an organization, but as we mentioned above, the
                biggest problem security engineers face is often just finding
                out what it is they need to test!
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, we needed to provide security engineers and developers
                with a list of security issues in their APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since APIs act as a business model layer, most of the critical
                security issues lie in the business processes underlying APIs.
                In security, issues obtained from breaking business processes
                are called Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), Broken
                Function Level Authorization (BFLA), and Broken Object Property
                Level Authorization (BOPLA).
              </p>
              <p>
                To find them, we knew we couldnâ€™t rely on traditional techniques
                like fuzzing. We needed to find a way to model the Business
                Process underlying the API and attempt to break it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Doing research on this topic, we discovered that modeling API
                business processes in a similar way to board games, like Chess
                or Go, worked surprisingly well. The underlying reason is
                simple: a board game is a state machine on which you can execute
                actions that must respect rules to change the gameâ€™s state.
                Think about moving the pieces in a chess game, each piece has
                its specific moves, and their position on the board represents
                the state.
              </p>
              <p>
                APIs are similar: they have a database, which represents the
                internal state, and API routes, which represent the actions you
                can run on the state. Of course, most APIs are more complex than
                a chess game because they have much more routes than there are
                chess pieces. In mathematics, we would say that the action space
                is much larger.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the models are similar enough for us to try applying
                alpha-beta, Monte-Carlo Search Three, and more advanced Machine
                Learning techniques that have proven to work well in the context
                of large action space games like Go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those were the foundational ideas behind our in-house algorithm,
                Feedback-Driven API Exploration (FDAE), which automatically
                identifies the underlying business processes and generates
                sequences of API requests especially aimed at breaking them,
                uncovering potential security flaws and data leaks.
              </p>
              <p>
                FDAE starts by ingesting the list of routes and parameters in an
                API. It first identifies the routes leading to sensitive data,
                like PII or financial information, and the parameters that have
                the most chances of being vulnerable to various kinds of
                injections and attacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Often, those routes require parameters like UUIDs or
                domain-specific values. Thatâ€™s where traditional security
                scanners fall short: they often fuzz randomly the parameters
                hoping to find some low-hanging fruit injection, but end up
                blocked at the data validation layer.
              </p>
              <p>
                FDAE is smarter. If it detects that the route /user/:uuid might
                be sensible, it will first look at all the other routes in the
                API and try to find one that returns a valid user UUID. Once it
                gets the valid user UUID, it will use it to trigger the
                /user/:uuid route and try to exploit it in many different ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there are no existing users in the database, but there is a
                route to create one, Escapeâ€™s FDAE will even be able to create a
                user, get its UUID, and then attempt exploiting the routes that
                require a user UUID.
              </p>
              <p>
                This process, very similar to what human penetration testers and
                bug hunters do, allows Escape to do extensive and deep testing
                of any API and business processes. Itâ€™s specifically good at
                finding many access control bugs like tenant isolation problems,
                complex multi-step injections, and request forgeries.
              </p>
              <p>
                To give a specific example, imagine youâ€™re building an
                e-commerce application, Escape can detect cases where users can
                bypass payment steps or modify input parameters in the request
                to access other userâ€™s orders or private information.
              </p>
              <p>

                API Exploration works with graphics here:

              <p>
                Escapeâ€™s entire scanning process takes minutes. It was very
                important to us, as former developers, to seamlessly integrate
                API testing in CI/CD pipelines and quickly implement relevant
                fixes. To verify that it was scalable, we scanned all public
                APIs on the internet and produced research reports on their
                quality: the State of GraphQL Security (<a
                  href="https://26857953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/26857953/State-of-GraphQL-security.pdf"
                  >https://26857953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/268579...</a
                >), and the State of Public APIs (<a
                  href="https://apirank.dev/state-of-public-api-2023/"
                  >https://apirank.dev/state-of-public-api-2023/</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from discovering and testing APIs in minutes, we wanted to
                make Escape actionable. Pinpointing a problem is one thing, but
                then how to fix it? Most dynamic scanners give vague remediation
                instructions. Escape actually generates code snippets to help
                developers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We offer a few monthly and yearly subscription plans based on
                the number of APIs and developers in the org, with a free 7 days
                trial. The pricing is accessible in the app during a trial
                period. Since our product is highly technical, we wanted to make
                sure that users can explore our features, evaluate what Escape
                does, and understand its value before making a decision. Users
                can see pricing details at a point in their trial journey where
                it makes the most sense, aligning with their understanding of
                the product. You can try us without a credit card at
                <a href="https://escape.tech">https://escape.tech</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our main SaaS product is closed source, but we publish many open
                source packages for security and developers on
                <a href="https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/"
                  >https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/</a
                >
                , some of them being widely used like GraphQL Armor (<a
                  href="https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-armor/"
                  >https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-armor/</a
                >)
              </p>
              <p>
                The number and complexity of APIs are constantly growing, and
                weâ€™re continuing to learn every day, so we would greatly
                appreciate and are eager for your feedback (no matter how big or
                small)! Thanks!
