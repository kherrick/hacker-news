              <p>
                Torque is a meta-assembler: instead of having an instruction set
                built into the assembler, you use macros to build up a small
                language that decribes an instruction set and then you use that
                to write your program. It's designed to work for any
                microcontroller/processor architecture, you build from the bit
                level upwards so there aren't any assumptions around word
                widths, instruction formats, or endianness.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created Torque initially to write programs for a PIC
                microcontroller, after running into difficulties with the
                official assembler. I've also used it to write programs for the
                Z80 processor inside an old TRS-80 computer.

              <p>
                Keeping up with the news is overwhelming in an age of
                information overload. Particle reimagines the experience by
                organizing articles into comprehensive "Stories," offering
                clear, concise summaries to quickly grasp what matters. Today,
                we reached the #1 spot in "Newspapers &amp; Magazine" on the iOS
                App Store—and I thought I'd share a bit of our backstory.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've been connected to this team for a long time. About 20 years
                ago, I shared a house with our CTO and co-founder Marcel Molina.
                I helped him get started with programming. Since then, Marcel
                has had an extraordinary career—becoming a senior staff engineer
                at Twitter, where he helped build foundational features like
                Retweets, Notifications, and Lists, and later working at Tesla
                on manufacturing execution systems that scaled across
                Gigafactories.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Twitter, Marcel worked closely with our CEO and product
                visionary Sara Beykpour, who led initiatives like Twitter Blue,
                Twitter Video, and the experimental app <i>twttr</i>. Sara has a
                background in Software Engineering and Cognitive Science from
                the University of Waterloo and spent over a decade at Twitter in
                engineering and leadership roles.
              </p>
              <p>
                In late 2022, Sara and Marcel started prototyping a news app
                that could reduce the cognitive and emotional burden of staying
                informed—by using AI to help people understand more, faster.
                They were soon joined by a few other former Twitter colleagues
                who helped shape the early concept into a working iOS
                application.
              </p>
              <p>
                I joined about 15 months ago to contribute across the entire
                stack. Since then, I've helped design and build major iOS
                features, rewritten our public website on Cloudflare Workers,
                and implemented new functionality in our Go backend, which is
                driven by Google Cloud's Pub/Sub architecture.
              </p>
              <p>What Makes Particle News Different</p>
              <p>
                Particle helps you navigate the news effortlessly—leveraging AI
                to help you understand more, faster. Some highlights:
              </p>
              <p>
                • Personalized News – Your feed is tailored to your interests.
                You can follow specific people, places, and things so you never
                miss what matters to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                • Clear Summaries – Get a quick overview or dive deeper with
                detailed, structured context—summarized in natural language.
              </p>
              <p>
                • Perspective Tools – Features like "Opposite Sides" and our
                political spectrum chart let you explore stories through
                multiple lenses.
              </p>
              <p>
                • Interactive Q&amp;A – Ask questions about any story and get
                concise answers with sources and citations.
              </p>
              <p>
                • Audio Summaries – Use the "Play" feature to listen to your
                feed, specific stories, or even select articles—great for
                hands-free or on-the-go moments.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the things we're most proud of is how Particle supports
                publishers. We've partnered with outlets like Reuters, AFP, and
                Fortune to host some of their content via APIs. These partners
                get prominent placement, and their links are highlighted in gold
                to stand out. This model aims to drive traffic back to
                publishers and reward high-quality journalism, rather than just
                aggregating and commodifying it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Transparency is a core value: all sources are cited, generated
                answers are grounded in evidence, and we take real care to
                prevent AI hallucinations or misleading summaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite negligible marketing spend, Particle has grown to the
                top of its category by focusing on engagement with early users
                and meaningful partnerships with the media ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coming soon: weekday mini crosswords—a new feature designed by
                another longtime friend of ours from 20 years back who went on
                to work at Twitter, lead development on Firewatch, and release
                his own games independently.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's incredibly fun and rewarding to be building something
                meaningful with old and new friends. I feel lucky every day to
                work alongside some of the best product, design, and engineering
                minds on a project we hope will help people stay engaged with
                democracy without burning out.

              <a href="https://www.mrge.io/home">https://www.mrge.io/home</a>),
              an AI code review platform to help teams merge code faster with
              fewer bugs. Our early users include Better Auth, Cal.com, and
              n8n—teams that handle a lot of PRs every day.
              <p>
                Here’s a demo video:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglEoiv0BgY"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglEoiv0BgY</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We (Allis and Paul) are engineers who faced this problem when we
                worked together at our last startup. Code review quickly became
                our biggest bottleneck—especially as we started using AI to code
                more. We had more PRs to review, subtle AI-written bugs slipped
                through unnoticed, and we (humans) increasingly found ourselves
                rubber-stamping PRs without deeply understanding the changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re building mrge to help solve that. Here’s how it works:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Connect your GitHub repo via our Github app in two clicks
                (and optionally download our desktop app). Gitlab support is on
                the roadmap!
              </p>
              <p>
                2. AI Review: When you open a PR, our AI reviews your changes
                directly in an ephemeral and secure container. It has context
                into not just that PR, but your whole codebase, so it can pick
                up patterns and leave comments directly on changed lines. Once
                the review is done, the sandbox is torn down and your code
                deleted – we don’t store it for obvious reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Human-friendly review workflow: Jump into our web app (it’s
                like Linear but for PRs). Changes are grouped logically (not
                alphabetically), with important diffs highlighted, visualized,
                and ready for faster human review.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AI reviewer works a bit like Cursor in the sense that it
                navigates your codebase using the same tools a developer
                would—like jumping to definitions or grepping through code.
              </p>
              <p>
                But a big challenge was that, unlike Cursor, mrge doesn’t run in
                your local IDE or editor. We had to recreate something similar
                entirely in the cloud.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whenever you open a PR, mrge clones your repository and checks
                out your branch in a secure and isolated temporary sandbox. We
                provision this sandbox with shell access and a Language Server
                Protocol (LSP) server. The AI reviewer then reviews your code,
                navigating the codebase exactly as a human reviewer would—using
                shell commands and common editor features like "go to
                definition" or "find references". When the review finishes, we
                immediately tear down the sandbox and delete the code—we don’t
                want to permanently store it for obvious reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know cloud-based review isn't for everyone, especially if
                security or compliance requires local deployments. But a cloud
                approach lets us run SOTA AI models without local GPU setups,
                and provide a consistent, single AI review per PR for an entire
                team.
              </p>
              <p>
                The platform itself focuses entirely on making <i>human</i> code
                reviews easier. A big inspiration came from productivity-focused
                apps like Linear or Superhuman, products that show just how much
                thoughtful design can impact everyday workflows. We wanted to
                bring that same feeling into code review.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s one reason we built a desktop app. It allowed us to
                deliver a more polished experience, complete with keyboard
                shortcuts and a snappy interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond performance, the main thing we care about is making it
                easier for humans to read and understand code. For example,
                traditional review tools sort changed files alphabetically—which
                forces reviewers to figure out the order in which they should
                review changes. In mrge, files are automatically grouped and
                ordered based on logical connections, letting reviewers
                immediately jump in.
              </p>
              <p>
                We think the future of coding isn’t about AI replacing
                humans—it’s about giving us better tools to quickly understand
                high-level changes, abstracting more and more of the code
                itself. As code volume continues to increase, this shift is
                going to become increasingly important.

                Like,you’d be working on your desktop, switch to your laptop,
                and all of a sudden you're forcibly logged out. No warning, no
                notification, just gone.
              </p>
              <p>Naturally, people thought this was a new policy.</p>
              <p>So they asked support.</p>
              <p>
                And here’s where it gets batshit: Cursor has a support email, so
                users emailed them to find out. The support peson told everyone
                this was “expected behavior” under their new login policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                One problem. There was no support team, it was an AI designed to
                'mimic human responses'
              </p>
              <p>
                That answer, totally made up by the bot, spread like wildfire.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users assumed it was real (because why wouldn’t they? It's their
                own support system lol), and within hours the community was in
                revolt. Dozens of users publicly canceled their subscriptions,
                myself included. Multi-device workflows are table stakes for
                devs, and if you're going to pull something that disruptive,
                you'd at least expect a changelog entry or smth.
              </p>
              <p>Nope.</p>
              <p>
                And just as people started comparing notes and figuring out that
                the story didn’t quite add up… the main Reddit thread got
                locked. Then deleted. Like, no public resolution, no real
                response, just silence.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be clear: this wasn’t an actual policy change, just a backend
                session bug, and a hallucinated excuse from a support bot that
                somehow did more damage than the bug itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                But at that point, it didn’t matter. People were already gone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Honestly one of the most surreal product screwups I’ve seen in a
                while. Not because they made a mistake, but because the AI
                support system invented a lie, and nobody caught it until the
                userbase imploded.
