            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I’ve been working on Shibuya, a next-generation Web Application
                Firewall (WAF) built from the ground up in Rust.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to build a WAF that didn't just rely on legacy regex
                signatures but could understand intent and perform at line-rate
                using modern kernel features.
              </p>
              <p>What makes Shibuya different:</p>
              <p>
                Multi-Layer Pipeline: It integrates a high-performance proxy
                (built on Pingora) with rate limiting, bot detection, and threat
                intelligence.
              </p>
              <p>
                eBPF Kernel Filtering: For volumetric attacks, Shibuya can drop
                malicious packets at the kernel level using XDP before they
                consume userspace resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dual ML Engine: It uses an ONNX-based engine for anomaly
                detection and a Random Forest classifier to identify specific
                attack classes like SQLi, XSS, and RCE.
              </p>
              <p>
                API &amp; GraphQL Protection: Includes deep inspection for
                GraphQL (depth and complexity analysis) and OpenAPI schema
                validation.
              </p>
              <p>
                WASM Extensibility: You can write and hot-load custom security
                logic using WebAssembly plugins.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ashigaru Lab: The project includes a deliberately vulnerable lab
                environment with 6 different services and a "Red Team Bot" to
                test the WAF against 100+ simulated payloads.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Dashboard: The dashboard is built with SvelteKit and offers
                real-time monitoring (ECharts), a "Panic Mode" for instant
                hardening, and a visual editor for the YAML configuration.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm looking for feedback on the architecture and the performance
                of the Rust-eBPF integration.

                The hardware is built around a stackable 10×10cm compute module
                with two ARM Cortex-A55 SBCs — one for ROS 2 navigation/EKF
                localisation, one dedicated to vision/YOLO inference — connected
                via a single ethernet cable.

                Everything — schematics, PCB layouts, firmware — is under open
                licences. The software stack runs on RoSys/Field Friend (for
                teams who want fast iteration) or DevKit ROS (for teams already
                in the ROS ecosystem). The idea is that a lab in one country can
                reproduce another lab's experiment by sharing a Docker image.

                Current status: the Open Core brain is largely fabricated, the
                full-size Sowbot body has a detailed BOM but isn't yet
                assembled, and we have two smaller dev platforms (Mini and Pico)
                in various stages of testing.

              pooler, load balancer and database sharder for PostgreSQL. If you
              build apps with a lot of traffic, you know the first thing to
              break is the database. We are solving this with a network proxy

              migrations.

              <p>
                The most important update: we are in production. Sharding is
                used a lot, with direct-to-shard queries (one shard per query)
                working pretty much all the time. Cross-shard (or
                multi-database) queries are still a work in progress, but we are
                making headway.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aggregate functions like count(), min(), max(), avg(), stddev()
                and variance() are working, without refactoring the app. PgDog
                calculates the aggregate in-transit, while transparently
                rewriting queries to fetch any missing info. For example,
                multi-database average calculation requires a total count of
                rows to calculate the original sum. PgDog will add count() to
                the query, if it’s not there already, and remove it from the
                rows sent to the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sorting and grouping works, including DISTINCT, if the
                columns(s) are referenced in the result. Over 10 data types are
                supported, like, timestamp(tz), all integers, varchar, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cross-shard writes, including schema changes
                (CREATE/DROP/ALTER), are now atomic and synchronized between all
                shards with two-phase commit. PgDog keeps track of the
                transaction state internally and will rollback the transaction
                if the first phase fails. You don’t need to monkeypatch your ORM
                to use this: PgDog will intercept the COMMIT statement and
                execute PREPARE TRANSACTION and COMMIT PREPARED instead.
              </p>
              <p>
                Omnisharded tables, a.k.a replicated or mirrored (identical on
                all shards), support atomic reads and writes. That’s important
                because most databases can’t be completely sharded and will have
                some common data on all databases that has to be kept in-sync.
              </p>
              <p>
                Multi-tuple inserts, e.g., INSERT INTO table_x VALUES ($1, $2),
                ($3, $4), are split by our query rewriter and distributed to
                their respective shards automatically. They are used by ORMs
                like Prisma, Sequelize, and others, so those now work without
                code changes too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sharding keys can be mutated. PgDog will intercept and rewrite
                the update statement into 3 queries, SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE,
                moving the row between shards. If you’re using Citus (for
                everyone else, Citus is a Postgres extension for sharding
                databases), this might be worth a look.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re like us and prefer integers to UUIDs for your primary
                keys, we built a cross-shard unique sequence, directly inside
                PgDog. It uses the system clock (and a couple other inputs), can
                be called like a Postgres function, and will automatically
                inject values into queries, so ORMs like ActiveRecord will
                continue to work out of the box. It’s monotonically increasing,
                just like a real Postgres sequence, and can generate up to 4
                million numbers per second with a range of 69.73 years, so no
                need to migrate to UUIDv7 just yet.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>    INSERT INTO my_table (id, created_at) VALUES (pgdog.unique_id(), now());
</code></pre>
              Resharding is now built-in. We can move gigabytes of tables per
              second, by parallelizing logical replication streams across
              replicas. This is really cool! Last time we tried this at
              Instacart, it took over two weeks to move 10 TB between two
              machines. Now, we can do this in just a few hours, in big part
              thanks to the work of the core team that added support for logical
              replication slots to streaming replicas in Postgres 16.
              <p>
                Sharding hardly works without a good load balancer. PgDog can
                monitor replicas and move write traffic to a promoted primary
                during a failover. This works with managed Postgres, like RDS
                (incl. Aurora), Azure Pg, GCP Cloud SQL, etc., because it just
                polls each instance with “SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()”. Primary
                election is not supported yet, so if you’re self-hosting with
                Patroni, you should keep it around for now, but you don’t need
                to run HAProxy in front of the DBs anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
                The load balancer is getting pretty smart and can handle edge
                cases like SELECT FOR UPDATE and CTEs with INSERT/UPDATE
                statements, but if you still prefer to handle your read/write
                separation in code, you can do that too with manual routing.
                This works by giving PgDog a hint at runtime: a connection
                parameter (-c pgdog.role=primary), SET statement, or a query
                comment. If you have multiple connection pools in your app, you
                can replace them with just one connection to PgDog instead. For
                multi-threaded Python/Ruby/Go apps, this helps by reducing
                memory usage, I/O and context switching overhead.
              </p>
              <p>
                Speaking of connection pooling, PgDog can automatically rollback
                unfinished transactions and drain and re-sync partially sent
                queries, all in an effort to preserve connections to the
                database. If you’ve seen Postgres go to 100% CPU because of a
                connection storm caused by an application crash, this might be
                for you. Draining connections works by receiving and discarding
                rows from abandoned queries and sending the Sync message via the
                Postgres wire protocol, which clears the query context and
                returns the connection to a normal state.
              </p>
              <p>
                PgDog is open source and welcomes contributions and feedback in
                any form. As always, all features are configurable and can be
                turned off/on, so should you choose to give it a try, you can do
                so at your own pace. Our docs (<a href="https://docs.pgdog.dev"
                  >https://docs.pgdog.dev</a
                >) should help too.
