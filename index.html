                I had a lot of fun practicing Rust and Learning some Bevy
                concepts with this repository.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bevy has an incredibly powerful dependency injection system and
                follows a pattern called ECS which makes it very powerful (and
                new to me).
              </p>
              <p>
                This simple &lt; 300 lines of code might help with learning some
                Bevy concepts.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also shows how to copmile for the web/WASM and inject a
                canvas for the game (or use a pre existing div).

                But I thought that rather than write a regular job post about
                them (boring!), it would be more fun to write about the history
                of the YC software team and what we've been up to. YC is a
                somewhat unusual place to work, and I wanted to give you a
                flavor of what it might be like.
              </p>
              <p>
                First off, a lot of people don't know that YC even has a
                software team, and for most of YC's history, we didn't. The
                first software YC wrote was Hacker News, and Paul Graham built
                and ran HN all by himself for many years.
              </p>
              <p>
                But around 2012, a young YC Partner named Garry Tan built this
                website to be a private directory and forum for the founders YC
                had funded. He called it "Bookface" as a tongue-in-cheek joke.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hacker News was built in Lisp (and still is), but Garry had used
                rails for his startup and didn't really want to learn lisp, so
                he built Bookface in rails. Bookface was an instant hit, but for
                several years after, the only people working on it were Garry
                Tan and a couple of other YC partners, who spent most of their
                time working with companies, and only really got to code on
                nights and weekends.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2015 I joined YC, and my first job on literally my first day
                was to try to figure out what to do with our software. By then,
                Bookface was getting big enough that it seemed clear to me that
                we needed full-time people working on it, and so we ended up
                finding a few key people to do that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that we had a small but real team, for the first time we
                were able to think about doing more ambitious things. We
                launched a website (<a href="https://workatastartup.com/"
                  >https://workatastartup.com/</a
                >) to help our companies hire people, and that did well. Then we
                launched a website (<a href="https://www.startupschool.org/"
                  >https://www.startupschool.org/</a
                >) to turn YC's advice about startups into an online course (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13801376"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13801376</a
                >). A few years later, we launched a co-founder matching
                platform (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27750298"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27750298</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the way we built a lot of other stuff we haven't talked
                about publicly, like all the internal tools that run YC. We've
                tried to make YC scale by writing software to automate as much
                of our business as possible. We have software that helps us read
                60K applications every year, our own Calendly-like software for
                scheduling the 10K+ meetings we do with founders every year,
                software to automate our financial and legal reporting and lots
                more stuff like that.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we've launched new products, we've added one or two people
                per year to the team so we can work on more things in parallel.
                We're up to about 10 now.
              </p>
              <p>
                When people are interviewing with us, they often ask us what the
                culture of the team is, and the answer is that if you've read
                Paul Graham's essays or watched our videos on YouTube, you
                already know what our culture is like. We try to operate
                according to the same advice we give to our startups.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've also tried to make the YC software team as closely
                connected to the batch as possible, which is part of staying
                close to our users (who are mostly YC founders and employees).
                Most of us work on the third floor of the YC building, and the
                batch happens on the first and second floors. So if you want to
                join one of the famous YC batch dinners, you just walk down to
                the first floor.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the things we hoped would happen was that some of the
                people on the team would take what they learned from working at
                YC and start their own YC companies. That turned out to work -
                there are now 7 people who have done exactly that.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've historically only hired a couple of people per year, but
                we've got a couple of roles open now. We're looking for someone
                to help Mark with infrastructure (see
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39019063"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39019063</a
                >), and we're also hiring someone to work on YC's private
                founder community site Bookface, which is more traditional
                full-stack web development. It's a little hard to describe
                Bookface if you haven't seen it - it's like LinkedIn and
                Facebook and Quora rolled into one, but just for YC founders.
                Most YC founders use it every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working at YC isn't a good fit for most people. I think it could
                be a good fit if you have been following YC for a while, if you
                are confident building web products all by yourself, if you like
                having a lot of responsibility and owning the development of
                products end-to-end, and if you like startups and have already
                worked on one or likely will someday. You’ll also need to live
                in SF or want to move here.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I first saw PRQL on Hacker News a few months ago, I was
                immediately captivated by the idea, yet equally disappointed
                that there was no integration for PostgreSQL. Having previous
                experience with writing PostgreSQL extensions in C, I thought
                this was a great opportunity to try out the pgrx framework and
                decided to integrate PRQL with PostgreSQL myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                The maintainers of both PRQL and pgrx were very nice to work
                with. Thanks guys.
