                Interestingly, I cannot find a single user of OpenClaw in my
                familiar communities, presumbly because it takes some effort to
                setup and the concept of AI taking control of everything is too
                scary for average tech enthusiasts.
              </p>
              <p>
                I scan through comments on HN, many of which were discussing
                about the ideas, but not sharing first-hand user experiences. A
                few HN users who did try it gave up / failed for various
                reasons:

                I smell hype in the air... HN users, have any of you actually
                run OpenClaw and let it do any things useful or interesting? Can
                you share your experience?

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                This was largely inspired by the work of Sydney Brenner, which
                became the basis of my brennerbot.org project.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, I became very fascinated by phages, which are
                viruses that attack bacteria. They're the closest thing to the
                "fundamental particles" of biology: the minimal units of genetic
                code that do something useful that allows them to reproduce and
                spread.
              </p>
              <p>
                They also have some incredible properties, like having a
                structure that somehow encodes an icosahedron.
              </p>
              <p>
                I always wondered how the DNA of these things translated into
                geometry in the physical world. That mapping between the
                "digital" realm of ACGT, which in turn maps onto the 20 amino
                acids in groups of 3, and the world of 3D, analog shapes, still
                seems magical and mysterious to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to dig deeper into the subject, but not by reading a
                boring textbook. I wanted to get a sense for these phages in a
                tangible way. What are the different major types of phages? How
                do they compare to each other in terms of the length and
                structure of their genetic code? The physical structure they
                assume?
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to make a program to explore all this stuff in an
                interactive way.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so I'm very pleased to present you with my open-source Phage
                Explorer:
              </p>
              <p>phage-explorer.org</p>
              <p>
                I probably went a bit overboard, because what I ended up with
                has taken a sickening number of tokens to generate, and resulted
                in ~150k lines of Typescript and Rust/Wasm.
              </p>
              <p>
                It implements 23 analysis algorithms, over 40 visualizations,
                and has the complete genetic data and 3D structure of 24
                different classes of phage.
              </p>
              <p>
                It actually took a lot of engineering to make this work well in
                a browser; it's a surprising amount of data (this becomes
                obvious when you look at some of the 3D structure models).
              </p>
              <p>
                It works fairly well on mobile, but if you want to get the full
                experience, I highly recommend opening it on a desktop browser
                in high resolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                As far as I know, it's the most complete informational /
                educational software about phages available anywhere. Now, I am
                the first to admit that I'm NOT an expert, or even that
                knowledgeable, about, well, ANY of this stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
                So if you’re a biology expert, please take a look and let me
                know what you think of what I've made! And if I've gotten
                anything wrong, please let me know in the GitHub Issues and I'll
                fix it:
