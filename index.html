              <a href="https://www.shimmer.care">https://www.shimmer.care</a>),
              and today we’re launching our new app called Indy (<a
                href="https://www.shimmer.care/indy"
                >https://www.shimmer.care/indy</a
              >). Indy is an ADHD app for structured planning, reflection, and
              self-awareness exercises. Here’s a demo:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDSDxyXv6i4"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDSDxyXv6i4</a
              >.
              <p>
                We started Shimmer in 2022 after my adult ADHD diagnosis, and
                have shipped several iterations of ADHD support since then (1:1
                coaching, web tools, body doubling, and AI-assisted coaching).
              </p>
              <p>
                Across these launches and 80k coaching sessions, we kept running
                into the same constraint: “knowing what to do” is rarely the
                problem for people with ADHD. The harder problem is actually
                doing it consistently over time, especially when attention,
                motivation, and emotional state fluctuate.
              </p>
              <p>
                That maps to a useful distinction that is explored in the
                literature (e.g.
                <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4589250/"
                  >https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4589250/</a
                >): “cool” executive function (future-oriented planning,
                direction, values) vs. “hot” executive function (in-the-moment
                emotion, urgency, impulse, overwhelm). Most tools lean hard into
                managing the latter. Productivity apps push execution, general
                chatbots give advice, but neither reliably supports the
                interaction between hot + cold EF across weeks and months.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we built Indy, an AI support system designed to support both.
                Here’s an overview of how it works:
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Guided future mapping</i>: users are guided to create a
                structured map of meaningful past experiences, current
                priorities, and upcoming future moments. This becomes the
                foundation for personalization so that everything that they do
                in the app helps move them closer to these goals
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Daily + weekly check-ins</i>: users engage in short,
                low-friction chat flows to set their priorities for the day
                (most popular use case is brain dumping priorities then having
                Indy help sort through them). The system does not assume
                consistency or linear progress, and adapts prompts based on
                prior behavior rather than enforcing a fixed routine.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Longitudinal insights</i>: over time, Indy surfaces patterns
                across inputs so users can see trends in effort, focus, and
                blockers. This helps counter the common ADHD experiences of 1)
                forgetting what works / doesn’t work, and 2) feeling like
                “nothing changed”
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Problem-solving when stuck</i>: when users report feeling
                blocked, Indy uses structured, behavior-change-informed prompts
                to help identify what is actually getting in the way (e.g.
                energy, clarity, emotional load, environment) and narrow toward
                a concrete next step
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Progress that includes effort</i>: Indy tracks wins, effort,
                and insights separately, and helps users draw out positive ways
                that members showed up (e.g. effort, mindset) even on days where
                no objective outcome was achieved
              </p>
              <p>
                Why use AI to do this? and why now? Two main reasons: (1)
                Affordability: Although continuous human support would mostly be
                better than a tech solution, that level of availability is too
                expensive for most people. Even weekly coaching (our core
                product) is still too expensive for many people. A tech solution
                allows some support rather than none. (2) Personalization: AI
                makes it possible to build systems that maintain continuity,
                personalize over time, and respond to context without relying on
                rigid templates or requiring constant human presence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main challenge we’ve experienced using AI for Indy is
                preventing it from collapsing into generic advice, productivity
                pressure, or over-automation/reliance. Instead, we’ve focused on
                using AI as scaffolding and capacity-building: something that
                supports reflection, problem solving, and accountability, while
                keeping agency with the user and clear boundaries around
                non-medical use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Indy is free to try:

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re building in applied AI, and/or if you have ADHD, we’d
                love to know: - what other AI tools you’ve tried for ADHD and
                things you liked vs. felt missing; -how you think about the role
                of AI vs. human support for ADHD in your life; - how the
                onboarding and first-use feels and any positive or critical
                feedback you have.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d love to hear your (ADHD) experiences or feedback on Indy.

                I built mdto.page because I often needed a quick way to share
                Markdown notes or documentation as a proper webpage, without
                setting up a GitHub repo or configuring a static site generator.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted something dead simple: upload Markdown -&gt; get a
                shareable public URL.
              </p>
              <p>Key features:</p>
              <p>Instant Publishing: No login or setup required.</p>
              <p>
                Flexible Expiration: You can set links to expire automatically
                after 1 day, 7 days, 2 weeks, or 30 days. Great for temporary
                sharing.
              </p>
              <p>It's free to use. I’d love to hear your feedback!</p>

                The core mechanism wants to be a "zero-touch" capture that
                happens at the connection gateway level. Instead of installing
                logging agents or scripts on every target machine, the tool
                reconstructs your terminal sessions from raw recording files
                generated by the proxy you use to connect. This "in-flight"
                capture means you get a high-fidelity log of every keystroke and
                output without ever having to touch the configuration of the
                remote host. It’s a passive way to build a personal knowledge
                base while you work.
              </p>
              <p>
                To handle the reality of context-switching, the tool is designed
                with a "multi-tenant" architecture. For an individual engineer,
                this isn't about managing different users, but about isolating
                project contexts. It automatically categorizes history based on
                the specific organization or project tags defined at the
                gateway. This keeps your work for different clients or personal
                side-projects in separate buckets, so you don't have to wade
                through unrelated noise when you're looking for a specific
                solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                In true nerd fashion, the search interface stays exactly where
                you want it: in the command line. There is no bloated web UI to
                slow you down. The tool turns your entire professional history
                into a searchable, greppable database accessible directly from
                your terminal.

              <p>
                I wanted to build a "compiler for business logic"—a tool where I
                could read a concept in 5 minutes and immediately test it in a
                hostile environment to see if my strategy actually compiles or
                throws a runtime error.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is a business simulator built on React 19 and
                TypeScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                The core technical innovation isn't just using AI; it's the
                architecture of a closed loop between a deterministic economic
                engine and a generative AI validation layer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest technical hurdle was building the Market Engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                I needed it to be mathematically rigorous, not a hallucinating
                chatbot. I wrote a custom `useMarketEngine.ts` hook that runs a
                discrete-event simulation. Every "run cycle," it solves a system
                of equations, including a specific Ad Fatigue formula—`1 / (1 +
                (power - 1) * fatigueFactor)`—to force diminishing returns.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also coded the "Theory of Constraints" directly into the state
                management: the system enforces bottlenecks between Inventory,
                Demand, and Capacity. For instance, a single employee has a hard
                cap of 7 operations per day. If you scale demand beyond that
                without hiring, the system burns your cash on lost orders.
              </p>
              <p>
                To handle the educational content, I moved away from hardcoded
                quizzes.
              </p>
              <p>
                I built a module that pipes the static lesson text into Gemini
                Flash to generate unique "Combat Cases" on the fly. The AI
                validates your strategy against the specific principles of the
                lesson (like LTV/CAC) rather than generic business advice.
              </p>
              <p>These two engines are connected by a "Liquidity Loop."</p>
              <p>
                Passing the AI cases earns you virtual capital ($500), which is
                the only fuel for the Market Engine. You literally cannot play
                the game if you don't learn the theory.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you go bankrupt, my heuristic `Advisor` analyzes your crash
                data—comparing `lostRevenue` vs `lostCapacity`—and links you
                back to the exact lesson you ignored.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am inviting you to test the full loop: read a brief, pass the
                AI simulation (Combat Cases ), and try to survive in the Market
                Engine.
              </p>

                maximum density—are the lessons <i>too</i> dry? 2. The AI
                Simulation: Does it accurately validate your logic based on the
                lesson? 3. The Market Economy: Does the math feel balanced, or
                is the "Ad Fatigue" too punishing?

              Countless voiceless people sit alone every day and have no one to
              talk to, people of all ages, who don't feel that they can join any
