                monitors how developers interact with your app and automatically
                generates and maintains test coverage nearing 100%. Even for the
                most complex applications. All without needing to write or
                maintain a single test.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our customers find it increases their end-to-end frontend
                development velocity by over 20%. If you’ve ever had the rare
                chance of working on a project where you can have near 100%
                confidence in your changes before you hit merge you’ll
                understand this immediately: programming feels completely
                different in that environment. Every dev can refactor with
                complete confidence and speed. And so they do, keeping the code
                fresh &amp; nimble. Our customers’s developers have been able to
                move faster than they’ve often ever experienced before.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re growing rapidly, and want to provide this experience to
                every software company in the world — while freeing them of the
                burden of writing or maintaining tests. We’ve built a team of
                exclusively world-class software engineers (“One of the
                strongest teams that I have seen” - Jared Friedman, Partner at Y
                Combinator).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you join us we’ll promise you’ll learn faster than you ever
                have in your career, and will be able to fundamentally change
                how the world develops software.
              </p>
              <p>## How does Meticulous work?</p>
              <p>
                You add a script tag on localhost and internal stacks, and
                Meticulous records all the development teams daily interactions
                with the app as they develop features. Meticulous understands
                every line of code, component and route executed by each flow
                and uses this to maintain a visual snapshot test suite that
                covers close to 100% of your code. This suite tests your apps
                UI, user flows and logic at all layers, across all edge cases,
                all branches, all feature flags. As your app evolves, your test
                suite evolves.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tests are executed in an environment that ensures full
                determinism from the lowest level, right down to how the
                browsers’ macro &amp; micro-tasks are scheduled — so no flakes.
                This bedrock of determinism is what makes the full system
                possible.

              <p>## What’s our team like?</p>
              <p>
                We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team
                previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir, GitHub and
                Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at
                these companies. We are backed by some of the best founders and
                technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch
                (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub),
                Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment),
                Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch
                of other incredible folks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an
                entire category of products to build on top of replay. This
                ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance
                impact of frontend code.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to change the way the world develops software, and
                influence software approaches for decades to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding
                engineer to join our team of six. We sponsor visas.

                You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here
                are a few problems you might work on:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of
                sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds. -
                Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains
                determinism. - Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover
                differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that

              here!
              <p>
                - crowdwave works best on your phone - unless you've got your
                headset and microphone plugged in to your desktop, in which case
                desktop works great too.
              </p>
              <p>Here's the story:</p>
              <p>
                So about six months ago I saw this post on HN
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39910119"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39910119</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://afterthebeep.tel">https://afterthebeep.tel</a>
                is really cool - it's an anonymous voicemail box - you call the
                provided phone the number and leave a message. Blaine - the guy
                who runs the site (eventually) listens to and approves your
                message and writes a headline. It was fun, and I found I kept
                going back to it and listening to the messages. I left a message
                once and several weeks later it appeared on the site. Blaine,
                from comments I read, didn't seem in a hurry to take the site
                much further, which got me thinking...
              </p>
              <p>
                And I simply could not get one question out of my head - "what
                would happen if users could just hit record on their phone,
                instead of having to dial a phone number?".
              </p>
              <p>
                When I get a software idea I get pretty obsessive and that
                question just kept gnawing at me.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, like the any reasonable programmer would, I stopped working
                on the project I had been working on for literally YEARS and
                took a detour. Because that's what you do isn't it - you just
                drop those multiple years of work and pick up the shiny new
                thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I saw that afterthebeep is open source and I loved the UI design
                - the Windows 3.1 aesthetic really appealed to me - it seems
                perfect for voicemail, so I grabbed the open source code and
                started development. I couldn't make much sense of the code - it
                was using tech I'm not familiar with, so I ditched it all except
                the layout and the graphics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, the project I had been working on for YEARS is
                basically a Twitter/Reddit clone, so I ripped the UI out of the
                afterthebeep open source project and did open heart surgery
                until like some bizarre Frankenstein's monster I had put the
                afterthebeep open source UI onto my code.
              </p>
              <p>
                And I added in the functionality that I craved so much - a
                "record" button. Sigh.... relief. It was incredibly satisfying
                to hit record and see a message appear almost immediately. Nerd
                craving fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p>
                But my satisfaction did not last long. I REALLY HAD TO fix that
                problem of getting the posts approved and headlines written. So
                I made a back end audio processing pipeline and fed the messages
                into an LLM, which ripped the text from the speech and I then
                shoved it into OpenAI and asked it to make nice headlines. And
                it worked beautifully - now you only have to wait 30 seconds to
                see your message with a nice headline! Ahhhh..... sigh,
                satisfaction... (it wouldn't be 2024 without an AI twist, would
                it now?).
              </p>
              <p>
                But hang on! It would be <i>SO much better</i> if there was some
                sort of category system almost like subreddits - then people
                could post their messages into areas of interest. So I built the
                channel system and sat back.... job done.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking at the calendar, dreading to see..... I've dropped into
                obsessive coding mode and and I've been down this rabbit hole
                full time for MONTHS. I'm getting wary - and I'm also getting
                tired and sick of the effort - when's this going to end?
              </p>
              <p>
                But wait, another idea! How much more cool would it be if you
                could have your own user account, and follow and like and
                subscribe! I've just GOT TO make that. AND surely it has to be
                multi language doesn't it? I mean Germans like talking too don't
                they? And user profile pics, and channel banner images, and
                options and settings. And if you don't put in terms and
                conditions and privacy and a cookie message then won't the
                Eurpoeans turn up and arrest me? At this stage I'm like a
                drunken junkie wanting just one more thing, one more thing......
                scope ain't just creeping, the scope is up and racing away
                faster than Usain Bolt.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm now like nearly five months into this and packing all this
                functionality into a UI that both make sense and fits onto a
                tiny phone screen is becoming a huge challenge - a challenge I
                don't know if I can actually solve - and if I can't make the UI
                make sense then the whole thing will be unusable. The UI MUST be
                minimal and yet still reveal to the user pretty much everything
                within fewer than five pages in total. The UI had to work BEST
                on a phone. That was a HUGE challenge, and I really didn't know
                until the end of the project if I could do it at all. But
                finally the UI seemed to come together and it was a tight
                squeeze but fit onto the limited screen resolution of even my
                old iPhone 6s (yes it's my main phone).
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, a few days ago, after many months of grueling grind, there
                was nothing left on the todo list. crowdwave was done! All the
                features were done and I'd finally chased down that scope creep.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                There are some similar tools but they are focused on "detecting"
                rather than "removing" so I've built one myself. I wanted a
                solution that's as minimal as possible; config files to specify
                the files in your project shouldn't be necessary because that
                info should be already configured in tsconfig.json. All you need
                to do is to specify your entrypoint file.
              </p>
              <p>Feedback is much appreciated!</p>
