              <p>
                Stack Auth was born out of years of frustration with the
                incumbents. We wanted to build something that is
                developer-friendly and open-source at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dominant player in this space is Auth0, who appeals to
                enterprises but lags behind in developer-friendliness and has
                strong vendor lock-in. A newer one is Clerk, which markets
                directly to devs, but is still entirely proprietary. Open-source
                solutions like Supabase Auth or Auth.js/NextAuth are only authN,
                and don't provide the rest of the toolchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the other hand, building your own auth infrastructure is
                tedious work. Rolling your own crypto is already hard enough,
                but on top you'll have to deal with OAuth flows, access tokens,
                RBAC, permission syncing, API keys, and so on. Most handcrafted
                OAuth or password-based applications in the wild are vulnerable
                in at least some of these areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                To us, the solution to this was obvious, so we decided to build
                it. Stack Auth is 100% open-source, licensed under MIT and AGPL.
                You can self-host, or choose to use our managed hosting. If you
                choose the latter, there's no lockin. You can export all your
                data and/or start self-hosting at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, we're more than just authentication — we have
                authorization (orgs, teams, permissions, RBAC) and user
                management (impersonation, user dashboard, webhooks).
              </p>
              <p>
                One interesting feature is what we call "connected accounts": we
                can manage and refresh your OAuth access tokens even for
                services that your users don't use for sign in, such as when
                accessing GMail or OneDrive APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also put a lot of weight into integrating deeply into the
                tech stack itself. For now, we support Next.js frontends with a
                bunch of components and hooks for sign-in, password reset, and
                organizations. Though, we do have a well-documented REST API (<a
                  href="https://docs.stack-auth.com/rest-api/auth"
                  >https://docs.stack-auth.com/rest-api/auth</a
                >), so you can access Stack from any language.
              </p>

                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love to hear about your own stories and opinions on auth.
                Thanks all!

              <p>
                Academic and market researchers want a DIY platform for survey
                research. Most existing tools are no-code, and these researchers
                want programmatic software that handles advanced branching logic
                and customization. We know this because we spent five years
                using open-source survey software for our academic work.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the key insights of RoundtableJS is to leverage
                JavaScript’s async/await functionality for managing survey
                logic. In other libraries survey logic is determined via
                callbacks that trigger when a page is submitted (i.e., if the
                user answers “Yes” to Q2, show page 3), which quickly becomes a
                nightmare to manage and debug. Our library lets developers build
                the timeline in an async function which means the logic flows
                intuitively from top to bottom.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, this fully programmable logic can be inaccessible to
                non-developers, and so our cloud offering
                (surveys.roundtable.ai) lets users program surveys using natural
                language by storing the library into context of an LLM (which
                acts as a library-specific copilot, demo link here:

                We think that being open-source will give us an edge in
                integrating LLMs into our platform. We designed RoundtableJS
                with LLM usage in mind, i.e. making it fully customizable and
                general-purpose. The alternative – building a library with a
                more constrained focus – would be more intuitive for unassisted
                programmers, but AI assistance makes it really easy to customize
                any part of the survey. Already we think this approach is easier
                and faster than no-code alternatives.
              </p>

                We left academia last year and have been building products in
                the survey space since. Our first product was an AI-powered
                survey simulator (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36865625"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36865625</a
                >). People loved playing with it, but it was difficult to
                monetize (as many HN comments predicted). We abandoned this,
                talked to customers, and found that data quality is a huge
                problem in market research (e.g.
                <a
                  href="https://www.kantar.com/company-news/kantar-partners-with-realeyes-to-tackle-billion-dollar-survey-fraud-problem"
                  >https://www.kantar.com/company-news/kantar-partners-with-rea...</a
                >). We released an API that analyzes open-end responses for low
                quality and fraudulent typing behavior. This helps firms save
                time cleaning data, but it is a limited market.
              </p>
              <p>
                We plan to monetize through our cloud offering, which currently
                offers instant link deployment, an interactive code editor and a
                fraud detection suite. We plan to introduce more features here
                in the analytics, design, and productivity space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Surveys are ubiquitous, but they are often bland and generic. By
                allowing people to fully customize them for today’s distribution
                channels, we want to make it easy to design better, more
                engaging surveys.

                Spawn lets you build apps with human language. You can include
                images, audio and other files in your app just by dragging and
                dropping.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's a demo video where I build the game of Snake in 60
                seconds:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIqp7cvmE_M"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIqp7cvmE_M</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                As it’s still in alpha, you may need to regenerate a few times
                to get the app functioning the way you want. So far I’ve found
                it’s pretty good at generating simple utilities and games. Over
                time, as both Spawn and the underlying models improve, it will
                be able to build more complex software.
              </p>
              <p>I have a bunch of ideas for future updates, for example:</p>
              <p>
                - Allow users to include wireframes that Spawn will follow as it
                generates their app.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Android support in Mac, Windows &amp; Linux Spawn desktop app.
                This way, people can use Spawn to build for both mobile
                platforms using the same app specifications. Imagine someone
                living in rural India using their Chromebook to build apps for
                their Android phone, without needing to learn how to code.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Enable people to build apps that have accounts and backend
                logic by autogenerating and deploying a backend during app
                generation.
              </p>
              <p>Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.</p>

                This enables non-technical teammates to launch native, prebuilt
                components directly in the product UI without involving
                engineering. We also provide the ability to update content (i.e.
                CMS), track user progress/state and target components to
                specific users from our admin panel.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new feature, called Collections (<a
                  href="https://frigade.com/blog/collections"
                  >https://frigade.com/blog/collections</a
                >), works by embedding a channel directly in code — think of it
                as a &lt;div /&gt; that can spawn an inline React component – or
                on the floating z-index level. For instance, a channel for UI
                cards that sits directly in your dashboard or floating
                experiences like surveys and popups. Collections can be styled
                using your own design system to feel native and blend in with
                the rest of your application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Collections also have air traffic controls (ATC) like cool-offs,
                limits, and priorities. You can think of it as an intelligent
                queue of React components in one “slot”. The ATC engine will
                automatically determine what order and when to show them. The
                rules can be useful to keep the user experience from getting
                spammy as your team launches more experiences at the same time.
                For instance, you can set it up so you only show one
                announcement modal per day max, or spread out in-app nudges to
                upgrade over a few weeks time.
              </p>
              <p>
                We were surprised by how hard it was to build this. The main
                challenges were: In order for the engine to respect the
                cool-offs and limits, we had to dig deep into the React
                rendering lifecycle to prevent the same component from rendering
                twice. This can happen when the same component is used in
                multiple Collections across the DOM tree. This is tough because
                a component can adhoc show up at any given time without notice
                due to the nature of dynamic web applications. We solved this by
                building a centralized client-side registry that keeps track of
                the DOM tree.
              </p>
              <p>
                Air traffic control is decided server side, and we knew we
                didn’t want to keep a web socket open indefinitely to render a
                simple component. So, we had to come up with a performant scheme
                that allowed the ATC logic tree to be transferred on initial
                render so the client-side can determine when each component
                should get rendered. For the first release, we offer a library
                of pre-built React components that can be easily launched in
                your web application. We’ll soon be adding the ability to launch
                any custom React components as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built this server-driven UI approach because we believe it
                provides teams an option that balances quality and speed. It’s
                also how companies like Uber, Pinterest and Rippling build and
                launch these in-app experiences internally, as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Compared to some of the existing no-code tools in the space, we
                believe this approach offers more control and flexibility. We
                like the idea that product and engineering can define the
                boundaries and designs of what non-technical teammates can
                launch in production. Especially when compared to similar tools
                where content can be injected any which way with WYSIWYG editors
                on top of an otherwise carefully crafted web application.
              </p>
              <p>
                What do you think about this approach? Have you built these
                kinds of flows in-house before or used one of the
                injection-based no-code tools? I’d love to hear any feedback or
                ideas on the launch. And feel free to play around with
                Collections yourself for free at frigade.com!

                We're using a third-party product that functions, but barely.
                The provider is understaffed and unresponsive and the platform
                is stagnant. It's a fight getting basic bugs fixed let alone new
                features implemented. We're having to resort to a separate
                low-code platform to fill in the gaps. Our business operates in
                a specific niche and there are no other providers who cater
                specifically to our industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we are growing we're running in to the limits of what this
                product can offer. We're being hampered in our speed of
                execution and missing crucial insights. I feel like we could do
                much better with a product catered specifically to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the other hand, while our current solution seems like a
                straightforward CRUD app, I fear the devil is in the details.
                Will we get stuck at 80% completion? We do a lot of data
                exchange via EDIFACT, for instance, with various government
                institutions all over Europe. This feels like a quagmire in
                which development can quickly stall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides, can we even attract experienced developers to a
                non-glamorous industry like logistics?
              </p>
              <p>We'd particularly appreciate input on:</p>
              <p>
                Strategies for attracting and retaining tech talent in a
                non-tech industry Experiences transitioning from third-party to
                in-house software (success stories and cautionary tales).
                Potential pitfalls we might not be considering. Alternative
                solutions we should explore.
              </p>
              <p>
                Has anyone here navigated a similar transition? What worked?
                What didn't? Any advice would be appreciated.
