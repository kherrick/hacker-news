              <p>
                After my own experiences with learning Vim, I wanted to skip the
                frustrating process of configuring a new tool before even
                learning how to use it. In an attempt to solve this problem, I
                started working on Vim Ninja, a web app that would allow
                developers to learn Vim through interactive lessons in the
                browser. It’s been a couple of months, and I’m proud to say that
                I’ve finally released
                <a href="https://VimNinja.com">https://VimNinja.com</a>!
              </p>
              <p>
                Check out a demo of the app here:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/reukQHKqMZE"
                  >https://youtu.be/reukQHKqMZE</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the technical side of things, I used SvelteKit to build the
                entire app and Tailwind, which turned out to be an amazing
                decision. I actually really like SvelteKit’s filesystem-based
                router as well as Svelte’s brevity, and Tailwind actually makes
                styling a fun task for me. I’m using CodeMirror 6 as a base for
                Vim Ninja’s code editor, and I really prefer it over more
                feature-packed alternatives like the Monaco Editor, which is
                what I started out with but soon abandoned due to its worse
                performance when compared to alternatives like CM6 and the sheer
                amount of bells and whistles that I just didn’t need.

                I recently changed my card and figured I would let the
                subscription expire.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fast forward to today. I go to print something and find that the
                printer is "unable to print" even though there is ample ink left
                in the cartridges. I press a button on the printer and it spits
                out a report that states the printer is unable to print, except
                for printer reports (!).
              </p>
              <p>
                I dig a little (since the error message they show provides no
                additional information beyond not being able to print) and find
                this thread [0] in their support forum. It turns out that once
                the subscription is cancelled or suspended, you are no longer
                able to use the ink that has been sent to you. Some even report
                not being able to print with cartridges they bought
                independently.
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out that their terms state that you're buying the
                ability to print x pages and the ink is actually always owned by
                HP, even when in your possession.
              </p>
              <p>
                This has to be one shadiest and just overall worst product
                experiences I've come across in a while.
              </p>
              <p>
                Printers have always been a bit of a pain but since when did
                they have to be near permanently connected to the internet else
                threaten to cut you off from all of their capabilities.
