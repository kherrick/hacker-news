              <p>
                We've talked to 100s of developers at places like Twilio, GE
                Healthcare, Redhat, Square, etc and there was a consistent theme
                in building AI apps: to move past a nascent demo they are left
                to their own devices in building out middle ware capabilities so
                that developers can move faster and ship with confidence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, the approach to building an enterprise-ready AI app is
                cobbling together a large set of mono-functional tools, adding
                LLM-based preprocessing steps to determine safety (e.g. applying
                governance and guardrails), ask clarifying questions to improve
                task performance, support common agentic operations by packaging
                and managing function calling scenarios manually, etc. Not to
                mention, all the undifferentiated work in incorporating
                different LLM models and versions, and managing resiliency,
                retries and fallback logic.
              </p>
              <p>
                ArchGW was built with the belief that prompts are nuanced and
                opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as
                traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent
                routing, robust observability, and integration with backend
                (API) systems for personalization – outside business logic. We
                help built Envoy while at Lyft and think its offers a great
                foundation to build a proxy to manage traffic for prompts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some additional details about the open source project.
                ArchGW is written in rust, and the request path has three main
                parts:
              </p>
              <p>
                * Listener subsystem which handles downstream (ingress) and
                upstream (egress) request processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Prompt handler subsystem. This is where ArchGW makes decisions
                on the safety of the incoming request via its prompt_guard
                primitive and identifies where to forward the conversation to
                via its prompt_target primitive.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Model serving subsystem is the interface that hosts all the
                lightweight LLMs[3] engineered in ArchGW and offers a framework
                for things like hallucination detection of our these models
              </p>
              <p>
                We loved building this open source project, and our belief is
                that this infrastructure primitive would help developers build
                faster, safer and more personalized agents without all the
                manual prompt engineering and systems integration work needed to
                get there. We hope to invite other developers to use and improve
                Arch. Please give it a shot and leave feedback here, or at our
                discord channel [4]
              </p>
              <p>
                Also here is a quick demo of the project in action [5]. You can
                check out our public docs here at [6]. Our models are also
                available here [7].

            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://replay.io">https://replay.io</a>. We've been
              building a time travel debugger for web apps for several years now
              (previous HN post:
              <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28539247"
                >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28539247</a
              >) and are combining our tech with AI to automate the debugging
              process.
              <p>
                AIs are really good at writing code but really bad at debugging
                -- it's amazing to use Claude to prompt an app into existence,
                and pretty frustrating when that app doesn't work right and
                Claude is all thumbs fixing the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                The basic reason for this is a lack of context. People can use
                devtools to understand what's going on in the app, but AIs
                struggle here. With a recording of the app its behavior becomes
                a giant database for querying using RAG. We've been giving
                Claude tools to explore and understand what happens in a Replay
                recording, from basic stuff like seeing console messages to more
                advanced analysis of React, control dependencies, and dataflow.
                For now this is behind a chat API (<a
                  href="https://blog.replay.io/the-nut-api"
                  >https://blog.replay.io/the-nut-api</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                We recently launched Nut (<a href="https://nut.new"
                  >https://nut.new</a
                >) as an open source project which uses this tech for building
                apps through prompting (vibe coding), similar to e.g.
                <a href="https://bolt.new">https://bolt.new</a> and
                <a href="https://v0.dev">https://v0.dev</a>. We want Nut to fix
                bugs effectively (cracking nuts, so to speak) and are working to
                make it a reliable tool for building complete production grade
                apps.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's been pretty neat to see Nut fixing bugs that totally stump
                the AI otherwise. Each of the problems below has a short video
                but you can also load the associated project and try it
                yourself.
              </p>

                - Exception thrown from a catch block unmounts the entire app:

                - A settings button doesn't work because its modal component

                Vidformer is a system that makes video annotation or
                transformation scripts practically instant. Traditional scripts
                that render full videos can take minutes—Vidformer speeds this
                up by optimizing execution and using on-demand rendering, so
                results appear immediately instead of waiting for entire videos
                to render. It works as a drop-in replacement for OpenCV's cv2,
                meaning most scripts can adopt it by simply changing "import
                cv2" to "import vidformer.cv2 as cv2"—no need to rewrite code or
                sacrifice flexibility. Vidformer is written in Rust and uses
                FFmpeg libraries for low-level video access.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, Vidformer runs code with symbolic references to
                frames and tracks frame modifications to build a declarative
                representation of the task. Then, when rendering, it can
                transparently distribute the workload across many cores and
                efficiently use additional memory for caching frames. Further,
                it can expose a Video on Demand endpoint and only render
                segments once requested; this lets playback begin instantly.

              <p>
                Recent weeks have put aviation safety on everyone’s mind, but
                we’ve been thinking about this problem for years. Both of us are
                pilots — we have 2,500 hours of flight time between us. Eric
                flew professionally and holds a Gulfstream 280 type rating and
                both FAA and EASA certificates. Kristian flies recreationally,
                and before this worked on edge computer vision for satellites.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know from our flying experience that air traffic management
                is imperfect (every pilot can tell stories of that one time…),
                so this felt like an obvious problem to work on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most accidents are the result of an overdetermined “accident
                chain” (<a
                  href="https://code7700.com/accident_investigation.htm"
                  >https://code7700.com/accident_investigation.htm</a
                >). The popular analogy here is the swiss cheese model, where
                holes in every slice line up perfectly to cause an accident.
                Often, at least one link in that chain is human error.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ll avoid dissecting this year’s tragedies and take a close
                call from last April at DCA as an example:
              </p>
              <p>
                The tower cleared JetBlue 1554 to depart on Runway 04, but
                simultaneously a ground controller on a different frequency
                cleared a Southwest jet to cross that same runway, putting them
                on a collision course. Controllers noticed the conflict
                unfolding and jumped in to yell at both aircraft to stop,
                avoiding a collision with about 8 seconds to spare (<a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yooJmu30DxY"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yooJmu30DxY</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Importantly, the error that caused this incident occurred
                approximately 23 seconds before the conflict became obvious. In
                this scenario, a good solution would be a system that
                understands when an aircraft has been cleared to depart from a
                runway, and then makes sure no aircraft are cleared to cross (or
                are in fact crossing) that runway until the departing aircraft
                is wheels-up. And so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                To do this, we’ve developed Yeager, an ensemble of models
                including state of the art speech-to-text that can understand
                ATC audio. It’s trained on a large amount of our own labeled ATC
                audio collected from our VHF receivers located at airports
                around the US. We improve performance by injecting context such
                as airport layout details, nearby/relevant navaids, and
                information on all relevant aircraft captured via ADS-B.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our product piggy-backs on the raw signal in the air (VHF radio
                from towers to pilots) by having our own antennas, radios, and
                software installed at the airport. This system is completely
                parallel to existing infrastructure, requires zero permission,
                and zero integration. It’s an extra safety net over existing
                systems (no replacement required). All the data we need is
                open-source and unencrypted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Building models for processing ATC speech is our first step
                toward building a safety net that detects human error (by both
                pilots and ATC). The latest system transcribes the VHF control
                audio at about ~1.1% WER (Word Error Rate), down from a previous
                record of ~9%. We’re using these transcripts with NLP and ADS-B
                (the system that tracks aircraft positions in real time) for
                readback detection (ensuring pilots correctly repeat ATC
                instructions) and command compliance.

              <p>
                There are different views about the future of ATC. Our product
                is naturally based on our own convictions and experience in the
                field. For example, it’s sometimes said that voice comms are
                going away — we think they aren’t (<a
                  href="https://www.ericbutton.co/p/speech"
                  >https://www.ericbutton.co/p/speech</a
                >). People also point out that airplanes are going to fly
                themselves — in fact they already do. But passenger airlines,
                for example, will keep a pilot onboard (or on the ground) with
                ultimate control, for a long time from now; the economics and
                politics and mind-boggling safety and legal standards for
                aviation make this inevitable. Also, while next-gen ATC systems
                like ASDE-X are already in place, they don’t eliminate the
                problem. The April 2024 scenario mentioned above occurred at
                DCA, an ASDE-X-equipped airport.
              </p>
              <p>
                America has more than 5,000 public-use airports, but only 540 of
                these have control towers (due to cost). As a result, there are
                over 100 commercial airline routes that fly into uncontrolled
                airports, and 4.4M landings at these fields. Air traffic control
                from first principles looks significantly more automated, more
                remote-controlled, and much cheaper — and as a result, much more
                widespread.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve known each other for 3 years, and decided independently
                that we needed to work on air traffic. Having started on this,
                we feel like it’s our mission for the next decade or two.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re a pilot or an engineer who’s thought about this stuff,
                we’d love to get your input. We look forward to hearing
                everyone’s thoughts, questions, ideas!

              Hey HN, I made a Windows process monitor for app developers and
              advanced end users. I wanted a taskmgr system-level graph view per
              app. Windows procmon, while capable, has always been tedious to
              set up (esp. if not used often). That's pretty much the whole idea
              behind the app--to simplify app-level monitoring, to make it easy.
              I hope some of you find it useful!

                I built a wireless, split, ultra-low profile keyboard from
                scratch called Bayleaf. As a beginner I learned all things
                electronics, PCB-building, designing for manufacturing, and many

                Given how useful AI research agents are across the internet, we
                decided to build an open-source equivalent for the workplace
                since a ton of questions at work also cannot be easily resolved
                with a single search. Onyx supports deep research connected to
                company applications like Google Drive, Salesforce, Sharepoint,
                GitHub, Slack, and 30+ others.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, an engineer may want to know “What’s happening with
                the verification email failure?” Onyx’s AI agent would first
                figure out what it needs to answer this question: What is the
                cause of the failure, what has been done to address it, has this
                come up before, and what’s the latest status on the issue. The
                agent would run parallel searches through Confluence, email,
                Slack, and GitHub to get the answers to these then combine them
                to build a coherent overview. If the agent finds that there was
                a technical blocker that will delay the resolution, it will
                adjust mid-flight and research to get more context on the
                blocker.

                Here’s a video demo I recorded:

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to get started with the GitHub repo, you can check
                out our guides at
                <a href="https://docs.onyx.app">https://docs.onyx.app</a>. Or to

                P.S. There’s a lot of cool technical details behind building a
                system like this so I’ll continue the conversation in the
                comments.
