                KPBJ is a freeform community radio station. Anyone in the area
                is encouraged to get a timeslot and become a host. We make no
                curatorial decisions. Its sort of like public access or a
                college station in that way.
              </p>
              <p>
                This month we launched our internet stream and on-boarded about
                60 shows. They are mostly music but there are a few talk shows.
                We are restricting all shows to monthly time slots for now but
                this will change in the near future as everyone gets more
                familiar with the systems involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                All shows are pre-recorded until we can raise the money to get a
                studio.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a site secured for our transmitter but we need to
                fundraise to cover the equipment and build out costs. We will be
                broadcasting with 100W ERP from a ridgeline in the Verdugos at
                about 1500ft elevation. The site will need to be off grid so we
                will need to install a solar system with battery backup. We are
                planning to sync the station to the transmit site with 802.11ah.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've built all of our web infrastructure using Haskell, NixOS,
                Terraform, and HTMX:

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a pretty substantial project involving a bunch of social
                and technical challenges and a shoe string budget. I'm feel
                pretty confident we will pull it off and make it a high impact
                local radio station.
              </p>
              <p>
                The station is managed by a 501c3 non-profit we created. We are
                actively seeking fundraising, especially to get our transmit
                site up and running. If you live in the area or want to
                contribute in any way then please reach out!

                No usage stats, no tracking, no illusions of mass adoption. The
                only real signal we get is the occasional person who appears in
                our Matrix chat going "hey, it booted on my watch from 2014 and
                now it's usable again" — and that's plenty.
              </p>
              <p>
                Privacy is non-negotiable: zero telemetry, no cloud, full local
                control. Longevity is the other half: we refuse to let good
                hardware become e-waste just because support ended. On the
                learning side, it's been one of the best playgrounds: instant
                feedback on your wrist makes QML/Qt, JavaScript watchfaces and
                embedded Linux feel tangible. The community is small and kind —
                perfect for people who want to learn open-source dev without
                gatekeeping.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technically we're still pragmatic: libhybris + older kernels on
                most devices since it just works, but we've already mainlined
                rinato (Samsung Gear 2) and sparrow (ASUS ZenWatch 2) — rinato
                even boots with a usable UI. That's the direction we're pushing
                toward.

                Questions, port requests, mentoring offers, criticism, weird
                ideas — all welcome. We do this because shaping a tiny, open
                wearable UX and infrastructure is oddly satisfying, and because
                Linux on the wrist still feels like a playground worth playing
                in.

                Until now, I typed the results manually and relied on tests to
                catch problems. While this is OK in e.g., GoLang, it is quite
                annoying in TypeScript. First, because of the more powerful type
                system (it's easier to guess that updated_at is a date than it
                is to guess whether it's nullable or not), second, because of
                idiosyncrasies (INT4s are deserialised as JS numbers, but INT8s
                are deserialised as strings).
              </p>
              <p>
                So I wrote pg-typesafe, with the goal of it being the less
                burdensome: you call queries exactly the same way as you would
                call node-pg, and they are fully typed.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's very new, but I'm already using it in a large-ish project,
                where it found several bugs and footguns, and also allowed me to
                remove many manual type definitions.

              <p>
                For nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we
                couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote
                us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC
                nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know
                I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative
                than most nonprofits. We spent 24/7 talking to users and coding.
                We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking,
                talking pg essays.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years we learned that product/market fit is different
                for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, "I'd love to
                donate to a nonprofit today" with the same oomph that they
                think, "I'd love a coffee" or "I'd like to make more money."
              </p>
              <p>
                No matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations
                grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I
                felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I
                eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.
              </p>
              <p>
                I made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth
                with Watsi's success. I believed that if I could somehow help
                every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some
                patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates
                raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling
                Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi
                on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that I have perspective, I'm incredibly proud of what the
                org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a
                tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M
                to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping
                patients for a long time to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here's a huge thank
                you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other
                important cause, even when it's not on the front page. I believe
                it embodies the best of humanity. Thanks HN!

              engineer for production. It connects to your observability tools
              like Sentry, Datadog, or user feedback channels, triages issues,
              and fixes them to cut your resolution time. Here's a demo:

                Sonarly is really about removing the noise from production
                alerts by grouping duplicates and returning a root cause
                analysis to save time to on-call engineers and literally cut
                your MTTR.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before starting this company, my co-founder and I had a B2C app
                in edtech and had, some days, thousands of users using the app.
                We pushed several times a day, relying on user feedback. Then we
                set up Sentry, it was catching a lot of bugs, but we had up to
                50 alerts a day. With 2 people it's a lot. We took a lot of time
                filtering the noise to find the real signal so we knew which bug
                to focus on.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, we saw how important it is to fix a bug fast
                when it hits users. A bug means in the worst case a churn and at
                best a frustrated user. And there are always bugs in production,
                due to code errors, database mismatches, infrastructure
                overload, and many issues are linked to a specific user
                behavior. You can't catch all these beforehand, even with E2E
                tests or AI code reviews (which catch a lot of bugs but
                obviously not all, plus it takes time to run at each
                deployment). This is even more true with vibe-coding (or agentic
                engineering).
              </p>
              <p>
                We started Sonarly with this idea. More software than ever is
                being built and users should have the best experience possible
                on every product. The main idea of Sonarly is to reduce the MTTR
                (Mean Time To Repair).
              </p>
              <p>
                We started by recreating a Sentry-like tool but without the
                noise, using only text and session replays as the interface. We
                built our own frontend tracker (based on open-source rrweb) and
                used the backend Sentry SDK (open source as well). Companies
                could just add another tracker in the frontend and add a DSN in
                their Sentry config to send data to us in addition to Sentry.
              </p>
              <p>
                We wanted to build an interface where you don't need to check
                logs, dashboards, traces, metrics, and code, as the agent would
                do it for you with plain English to explain the "what," "why,"
                and "how do I fix it."
              </p>
              <p>
                We quickly realized companies don't want to add a new tracker or
                change their monitoring stack, as these platforms do the job
                they're supposed to do. So we decided to build above them. Now
                we connect to tools like Sentry, Datadog, Slack user feedback
                channels, and other integrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claude Code is so good at writing code, but handling runtime
                issues requires more than just raw coding ability. It demands
                deep runtime context, immediate reactivity, and intelligent
                triage, you can’t simply pipe every alert directly into an
                agent. That’s why our first step is converting noise into
                signal. We group duplicates and filter false positives to
                isolate clear issues. Once we have a confirmed signal, we
                trigger Claude Code with the exact context it needs, like the
                specific Sentry issue and relevant logs fetched via MCP (mostly
                using grep on Datadog/Grafana). However, things get
                exponentially harder with multi-repo and multi-service
                architectures.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we built an internal map of the production system that is
                basically a .md file updated dynamically. It shows every link
                between different services, logs, and metrics so that Claude
                Code can understand the issue faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of our users using Sentry was receiving ~180 alerts/day.
                Here is what their workflow looked like:
              </p>
              <p>- Receive the alert</p>
              <p>
                - 1) Defocus from their current task or wake up, or 2) don't
                look at the alert at all (most of the time)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Go check dashboards to find the root cause (if infra type) or
                read the stack trace, events, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Try to figure out if it was a false positive or a real problem
                (or a known problem already in the fixes pipeline)
              </p>
              <p>- Then fix by giving Claude Code the correct context</p>
              <p>
                We started by cutting the noise and went from 180/day to 50/day
                (by grouping issues) and giving a severity based on the impact
                on the user/infra. This brings it down to 5 issues to focus on
                in the current day. Triage happens in 3 steps: deduplicating
                before triggering a coding agent, gathering the root cause for
                each alert, and re-grouping by RCA.

                  >https://sonarly.com</a
                >) and we would love to have feedback from engineers. Especially
                curious about your current workflows when you receive an alert
                from any of these channels like Sentry (error tracking), Datadog
                (APM), or user feedback. How do you assign who should fix it?
                Where do you take your context from to fix the issue? Do you
                have any automated workflow to fix every bug, and do you have
                anything you use currently to filter the noise from alerts?
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a large free tier as we mainly want feedback. You can
                self-serve under 2 min. I'll be in the thread with my co-founder
                to answer your questions, give more technical details, and take
                your feedback: positive, negative, brutal, everything's
                constructive!
              </p>

              I've been teaching LLMs to play Magic: The Gathering recently, via
              MCP tools hooked up to the open-source XMage codebase. It's still
              pretty buggy and I think there's significant room for existing
              models to get better at it via tooling improvements, but it pretty
              much works today. The ratings for expensive frontier models are
              artificially low right now because I've been focusing on cheaper
              models until I work out the bugs, so they don't have a lot of
              games in the system.

                My favorite languages are Smalltalk and Lisp, but as an Emacs
                user, I've been using the latter for much longer and for my
                current projects, Common Lisp is a better fit, so I call myself
                "a Lisp-er" these days. If people like what I did, I do have
                plans to write some more (but probably only after I retire,
                writing next to a full-time job is heard). Maybe on Smalltalk,
                maybe on computer networks - two topics close to my heart.

                And a shout-out to Dick Gabriel, he contributed some great
                personal memories about the man who started it all, John
                McCarthy.
