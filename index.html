              <a href="https://app.trysift.dev/">https://app.trysift.dev/</a>.
              <p>
                We used to work on product and engineering at Datadog and
                Splunk. We saw how even teams using these industry-leading tools
                were struggling to effectively interpret and use their logging
                data. The sheer volume of logs overwhelmed experts and newcomers
                alike, making it difficult to quickly identify meaningful issues
                or patterns. Despite powerful indexing and search capabilities,
                developers still had to manually piece together context from
                different logs, dashboards, and sources—a tedious and
                error-prone process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The “noisy logging” problem—that is, the gap between
                overwhelming amounts of raw log data and insights people can act
                on—ultimately is a gap between machines (which generate all this
                data) and humans (who want and need the insights). SiftDev is
                built to bridge that gap and to automate the tedious, manual
                aspects of debugging and observability. In marketing-speak:
                “humans should never have to look at a log again!” We think
                people should interact with their data in terms that make sense
                on a human level.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes SiftDev different is its understanding of application
                context over time. While traditional tooling typically lets
                developers analyze logs in isolation, or with minimal
                surrounding context, SiftDev builds comprehensive profiles of
                your application's normal behavior patterns. This awareness
                allows us to understand what's truly abnormal versus what might
                appear unusual in a single snapshot but is actually expected
                behavior for your specific application. SiftDev applies semantic
                analysis and profiling to understand your application's logging
                behavior holistically. Instead of relying solely on manual
                search, Sift identifies core application processes,
                automatically detects patterns, and surfaces anomalies,
                including clear explanations and context.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some examples of what this can look like in practice:
                Identify core processes: SiftDev instantly recognizes your
                payment workflows—like authorization, capture, and
                refunds—without manual tagging. Detect performance patterns:
                SiftDev learns your nightly batch job typically handles 10,000
                records in 45 minutes, establishing a clear baseline. Surface
                hidden anomalies: SiftDev flags silent failures, such as two
                microservices updating the same record within 50ms—issues
                normally hidden by routine logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can then directly ask your logs questions like, “What's
                causing errors in our checkout service?” or “Why did latency
                spike at 2 AM?” and immediately receive insightful, actionable
                answers that you’d otherwise manually be searching for.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love for you to test out our product via our demo
                playground at
                <a href="https://app.trysift.dev/">https://app.trysift.dev/</a>!
                It’s a slightly less functional version of our platform but
                shares a lot of the core features. Note: we do need users to
                sign up to do this but waitlist is optional (of course).

              <p>
                I'm also interested in the user experience of setupless
                container execution. Containers have greatly improved program
                distribution, but serverless container cloud runtimes like
                Google Cloud Run or AWS Lambda still require transferring the
                container image, creating an executor, and invoking the
                executor. These cloud services also come with hardware caps like
                memory limits where if you need more than that, you're back to
                provisioning a server. I want science researchers for instance
                to be able to run any computational tool with no setup. Program
                Explorer is a step in that direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                You choose a container image, set the args, edit the files you
                want to have at /run/pe/input, then it gets run in a fresh VM
                and sends back stdout, stderr, and whatever is in
                /run/pe/output. No network access.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also set env vars and attach a file as stdin for more
                control. Most flexibility comes from containers with a shell so
                that you can write a script to run multiple commands.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, you can only pick container images from a predefined
                list, but suggestions on what to include are welcome. Each run
                is limited to 1 second (wall clock on a dedicated core) and 1 GB
                memory as right now the focus is on quick tests/demos.
              </p>
              <p>
                The files you send and produce are never written to disk and not
                stored after your request is complete.
              </p>

                >. Briefly how it works: container images get packed (ahead of
                time) into an erofs image, a VM is run with cloud-hypervisor,
                init process unpacks your files and mounts the rootfs, crun runs
                the container, then pack your output files and exit code etc.
                (rusage is in there too if you open the JS console). The server
                is written as a load balancer using pingora so multiple workers
                could (eventually) be used, but that is a WIP and currently only
                has one worker.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have lots of ideas and directions I'd like to take this but
                wanted to ship something so others could start playing with it.
                Looking forward to hearing your ideas and feedback!

                Pila (<a href="https://pila.energy/">https://pila.energy/</a>)
                is a home battery that plugs into a standard wall outlet,
                provides smart backup power, energy shifting, and grid services.
                It’s more than a power bank—it’s a distributed energy system
                that can scale across multiple rooms, entire buildings, and work
                together in real time as a coordinated system. We built Pila to
                be local first with an open API to allow developers to build use
                cases on top of our hardware (Home Assistant, etc).
              </p>
              <p>
                Big batteries like Tesla Powerwall and Enphase are great if you
                own a home and can afford a $10K+ electrical project, but they
                require permanent installation, electricians, and panel
                upgrades—which makes them inaccessible for renters, apartments,
                and cost-conscious homeowners. Over 50% of the cost of
                installing a Powerwall isn’t even the battery itself—it’s soft
                costs: labor, permitting, etc. We wanted to create an entry
                point for more people to access energy security at home.
              </p>
              <p>How does it work?</p>
              <p>
                Plug Pila into any 120V wall outlet, and power passes through to
                connected devices and appliances. The inverter, LFP battery,
                BMS, grid disconnection, controller, and wireless connectivity
                are all built in. (details at
                <a href="https://pila.energy/tech-specs"
                  >https://pila.energy/tech-specs</a
                >)
              </p>
              <p>
                When an outage happens, the onboard inverter detects the power
                loss within 20ms and automatically disconnects from the grid
                (islanding). Whether you’re home or away, backup kicks in
                instantly. A built-in cellular radio ensures you get a
                notification even if your home WiFi is out. Pila is 1.6kWh. That
                will backup a standard fridge for over a day.
              </p>
              <p>
                One key challenge we faced with a distributed architecture was
                coordination between batteries, for things like solar-following
                and managing real-time draw from your utility connection. Unlike
                large garage systems, where you can run a wired CAN bus, our
                batteries are spread across the home. We’re solving this with a
                sub-GHz wireless mesh network—self-healing, coordinator-less,
                and designed to make setup and expansion as simple as plugging
                in another unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Long-term, we’d love to open up this protocol to provide a more
                reliable communication layer for energy products in noisy built
                environments—reducing reliance on consumer Wi-Fi.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to deliver the value you’d expect from a whole-home
                battery like Powerwall, in a plug-in format. That means going
                beyond a basic lead acid UPS with real home energy management,
                useful insights about power use, power larger loads like sump
                pumps, and even deliver grid services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most portable batteries are missing the functionality that makes
                a home battery useful: no bidirectional power, no integration
                with solar or smart home systems, and no ability to manage home
                energy dynamically. They tend to be boxy, ruggedized, meant to
                be moved around, not seamlessly integrated into your living
                space. On top of that, many use e-mobility battery chemistries,
                which are great for delivering high power on demand but wear out
                faster when cycled daily for home energy use.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a renter myself, I started Pila because these awesome energy
                products aren’t accessible enough. And frankly, generators are
                loud, expensive, and a pain to deal with. Even many Powerwall
                owners I’ve talked to say they really care about keeping the
                fridge, WiFi, and a sump pump running—so why does energy
                resilience have to be so complicated and expensive?
              </p>
              <p>
                As the grid struggles to keep up with demand, we believe
                modular, renter-friendly batteries can make home energy
                resilience more accessible.
              </p>
              <p>
                What's been your experience with home batteries? What recent
                power outages have you had, and how were you affected?

              <p>
                FLE is an open-source framework for developing and evaluating
                LLM agents in Factorio. It provides a controlled environment
                where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource
                management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with
                meaningful constraints.
              </p>
              <p>
                A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded
                nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer
                models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't
                be "solved" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This
                allows us to meaningfully compare models by the
                order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a
                benchmark with longevity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio,
                recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few
                months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to
                create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial
                reasoning and long-term planning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we
                discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP
                enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding
                the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that
                wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted
                interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through
                familiar programming paradigms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern: 1. They observe
                the world (seeing the output of their last action) 2. Generate
                Python code to perform their next action 3. Receive detailed
                feedback (including exceptions and stdout)
              </p>
              <p>
                We provide two main evaluation settings: - Lab-play: 24
                structured tasks with fixed resources - Open-play: An unbounded
                task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally
                generated map
              </p>
              <p>
                We found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills,
                they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained
                environments. They can discover basic automation strategies
                (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more
                complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing).
                Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant
                margin).
              </p>
              <p>
                The code is available at
                <a

                  >https://github.com/JackHopkins/factorio-learning-environment</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                You'll need: - Factorio (version 1.1.110) - Docker - Python
                3.10+
              </p>
              <p>
                The README contains detailed installation instructions and
                examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do
                with this framework!
