                >https://www.shimmer.care/indy</a
              >). Indy is an ADHD app for structured planning, reflection, and
              self-awareness exercises. Here’s a demo:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDSDxyXv6i4"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDSDxyXv6i4</a
              >.
              <p>
                We started Shimmer in 2022 after my adult ADHD diagnosis, and
                have shipped several iterations of ADHD support since then (1:1
                coaching, web tools, body doubling, and AI-assisted coaching).
              </p>
              <p>
                Across these launches and 80k coaching sessions, we kept running
                into the same constraint: “knowing what to do” is rarely the
                problem for people with ADHD. The harder problem is actually
                doing it consistently over time, especially when attention,
                motivation, and emotional state fluctuate.
              </p>
              <p>
                That maps to a useful distinction that is explored in the
                literature (e.g.
                <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4589250/"
                  >https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4589250/</a
                >): “cool” executive function (future-oriented planning,
                direction, values) vs. “hot” executive function (in-the-moment
                emotion, urgency, impulse, overwhelm). Most tools lean hard into
                managing the latter. Productivity apps push execution, general
                chatbots give advice, but neither reliably supports the
                interaction between hot + cold EF across weeks and months.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we built Indy, an AI support system designed to support both.
                Here’s an overview of how it works:
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Guided future mapping</i>: users are guided to create a
                structured map of meaningful past experiences, current
                priorities, and upcoming future moments. This becomes the
                foundation for personalization so that everything that they do
                in the app helps move them closer to these goals
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Daily + weekly check-ins</i>: users engage in short,
                low-friction chat flows to set their priorities for the day
                (most popular use case is brain dumping priorities then having
                Indy help sort through them). The system does not assume
                consistency or linear progress, and adapts prompts based on
                prior behavior rather than enforcing a fixed routine.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Longitudinal insights</i>: over time, Indy surfaces patterns
                across inputs so users can see trends in effort, focus, and
                blockers. This helps counter the common ADHD experiences of 1)
                forgetting what works / doesn’t work, and 2) feeling like
                “nothing changed”
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Problem-solving when stuck</i>: when users report feeling
                blocked, Indy uses structured, behavior-change-informed prompts
                to help identify what is actually getting in the way (e.g.
                energy, clarity, emotional load, environment) and narrow toward
                a concrete next step
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Progress that includes effort</i>: Indy tracks wins, effort,
                and insights separately, and helps users draw out positive ways
                that members showed up (e.g. effort, mindset) even on days where
                no objective outcome was achieved
              </p>
              <p>
                Why use AI to do this? and why now? Two main reasons: (1)
                Affordability: Although continuous human support would mostly be
                better than a tech solution, that level of availability is too
                expensive for most people. Even weekly coaching (our core
                product) is still too expensive for many people. A tech solution
                allows some support rather than none. (2) Personalization: AI
                makes it possible to build systems that maintain continuity,
                personalize over time, and respond to context without relying on
                rigid templates or requiring constant human presence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main challenge we’ve experienced using AI for Indy is
                preventing it from collapsing into generic advice, productivity
                pressure, or over-automation/reliance. Instead, we’ve focused on
                using AI as scaffolding and capacity-building: something that
                supports reflection, problem solving, and accountability, while
                keeping agency with the user and clear boundaries around
                non-medical use.
              </p>
              <p>

                If you’re building in applied AI, and/or if you have ADHD, we’d
                love to know: - what other AI tools you’ve tried for ADHD and
                things you liked vs. felt missing; -how you think about the role
                of AI vs. human support for ADHD in your life; - how the
                onboarding and first-use feels and any positive or critical
                feedback you have.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d love to hear your (ADHD) experiences or feedback on Indy.

              <a href="https://1code.dev">https://1code.dev</a>), a local UI for
              Claude Code.
              <p>
                Here's a video of the product:

              <p>
                Claude Code has been our go-to for 4 months. When Opus 4.5
                dropped, parallel agents stopped needing so much babysitting. We
                started trusting it with more: building features end to end,
                adding tests, refactors. Stuff you'd normally hand off to a
                developer. We started running 3-4 at once. Then the CLI became
                annoying: too many terminals, hard to track what's where, diffs
                scattered everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we built 1Code.dev, an app to run your Claude Code agents in
                parallel that works on Mac and Web. On Mac: run locally, with or
                without worktrees. On Web: run in remote sandboxes with live
                previews of your app, mobile included, so you can check on
                agents from anywhere. Running multiple Claude Codes in parallel
                dramatically sped up how we build features.
              </p>
              <p>
                What’s next: Bug bot for identifying issues based on your
                changes; QA Agent, that checks that new features don't break
                anything; Adding OpenCode, Codex, other models and coding
                agents. API for starting Claude Codes in remote sandboxes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Try it out! We're open-source, so you can just bun build it. If
                you want something hosted, Pro ($20/mo) gives you web with live
                browser previews hosted on remote sandboxes. We’re also working
                on API access for running Claude Code sessions programmatically.
              </p>
              <p>We'd love to hear your feedback!</p>
