            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://livedocs.com">https://livedocs.com</a>). We're
              building an AI-native data workspace that lets teams ask questions
              of their real data and have the system plan, execute, and maintain
              the analysis end-to-end.
              <p>
                We previously posted about LiveDocs four years ago (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30735058"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30735058</a
                >). Back then, LiveDocs was a no-code analytics tool for
                stitching together metrics from tools like Stripe and Google
                Analytics. It worked for basic reporting, but over time we ran
                into the same ceiling our users did. Dashboards are fine until
                the questions get messy, and notebooks slowly turn into
                hard-to-maintain piles of glue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the last few years, we rebuilt LiveDocs almost entirely
                around a different idea. Data work should behave like a living
                system, not a static document or a chat transcript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, LiveDocs is a reactive notebook environment backed by
                real execution engines. Notebooks are not linear. Each cell
                participates in a dependency graph, so when data or logic
                changes, only the affected parts recompute. You can freely mix
                SQL, Python, charts, tables, and text in the same document and
                everything stays in sync. Locally we run on DuckDB and Polars,
                and when you connect a warehouse like Snowflake, BigQuery, or
                Postgres, queries are pushed down instead of copying data out.
                Every result is inspectable and reproducible.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of this environment sits an AI agent, but it is not "chat
                with your data." The agent works inside the notebook itself. It
                can plan multi-step analyses, write and debug SQL or Python,
                spawn specialized sub-agents for different tasks, run code in a
                terminal, and browse documentation or the web when it lacks
                context. Because it operates inside the same execution graph as
                humans, you can see exactly what it ran, edit it, or take over
                at any point.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also support a canvas mode where the agent can build custom
                UI for your analysis, not just charts. This includes tables with
                controls, comparisons, and derived views that stay wired to the
                underlying data. When a notebook is not the right interface, you
                can publish parts of it as an interactive app. These behave more
                like lightweight internal tools, similar in spirit to Retool,
                but backed by the same analysis logic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything in LiveDocs is fully real-time collaborative.
                Multiple people can edit the same notebook, see results update
                live, comment inline, and share documents or apps without
                exposing raw code unless they want to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Teams use LiveDocs to investigate questions that do not fit
                cleanly into dashboards, build analyses that evolve over time
                without constant rewrites, and automate recurring questions
                without turning them into brittle pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pricing is pay-as-you-go, starting at $15 per month, with a free
                tier so people can try it without talking to us. You'll have to
                sign up, as it requires us to provision a sandbox for your to
                run your notebook. Here's a video demo:

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We are still learning where this breaks. Long-running agent
                workflows on production data surface a lot of sharp edges. We
                would love feedback from people who have built or lived with
                analytics systems, notebooks, or "chat with your data" tools and
                felt their limits. Happy to go deep on technical details and
                trade notes.

              >.
              <p>
                Here's a demo video:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/cyEgW7wElcs"
                  >https://youtu.be/cyEgW7wElcs</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Why is this useful? (1) You don't have to figure out which
                webhooks you need or write listeners for each one. The library
                handles all of that. This follows the approach of libraries like
                dj-stripe in the Django world (<a href="https://dj-stripe.dev/"
                  >https://dj-stripe.dev/</a
                >). (2) Stripe's API has a 100 rpm rate limit. If you're
                checking subscription status frequently or building internal
                tools, you'll hit it. Querying your own Postgres doesn't have
                this problem. (3) You can give an AI agent read access to the
                stripe.* schema to debug payment issues—failed charges, refunds,
                whatever—without handing over Stripe dashboard access. (4) You
                can join Stripe data with your own tables for custom analytics,
                LTV calculations, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                It creates a webhook endpoint in your Stripe account to forward
                webhooks to your backend where a webhook listener stores all the
                data into a new <i>stripe.*</i> schema. You define your plans in
                TypeScript, run a sync command, and the library takes care of
                creating Stripe products and prices, handling webhooks, and
                keeping your database in sync. We also let you backfill your
                Stripe data for existing accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                It supports pre-paid usage credits, account wallets and
                usage-based billing. It also lets you generate a pricing table
                component that you can customize. You can access the user
                information using the simple API the library provides:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  billing.subscriptions.get({ userId });
  billing.credits.consume({ userId, key: "api_calls", amount: 1 });
  billing.usage.record({ userId, key: "ai_model_tokens_input", amount: 4726 });
</code></pre>
              Effectively, you don't have to deal with either the Stripe
              dashboard or the Stripe API/SDK any more if you don't want to. The
              library gives you a nice abstraction on top of Stripe that should
              cover ~most subscription payment use-cases.
              <p>
                Let's see how it works with a quick example. Say you have a
                billing plan like Cursor (the IDE) used to have: $20/mo, you get
                500 API completions + 2000 tab completions, you can buy
                additional API credits, and any additional usage is billed as
                overage.
              </p>
              <p>You define your plan in TypeScript:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  {
    name: "Pro",
    description: "Cursor Pro plan",
    price: [{ amount: 2000, currency: "usd", interval: "month" }],
    features: {
      api_completion: {
        pricePerCredit: 1,              // 1 cent per unit
        trackUsage: true,               // Enable usage billing
        credits: { allocation: 500 },
        displayName: "API Completions",
      },
      tab_completion: {
        credits: { allocation: 2000 },
        displayName: "Tab Completions",
      },
    },
  }
</code></pre>
              Then on the CLI, you run the `init` command which creates the DB
              tables + some API handlers. Run `sync` to sync the plans to your
              Stripe account and create a webhook endpoint. When a subscription
              is created, the library automatically grants the 500 API
              completion credits and 2000 tab completion credits to the user.
              Renewals and up/downgrades are handled sanely.
              <p>Consume code would look like this:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  await billing.credits.consume({
    userId: user.id,
    key: "api_completion",
    amount: 1,
  });
</code></pre>
              And if they want to allow manual top-ups by the user:
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  await billing.credits.topUp({
    userId: user.id,
    key: "api_completion",
    amount: 500,     // buy 500 credits, charges $5.00
  });
</code></pre>
              Similarly, we have APIs for wallets and usage.
              <p>
                This would be a lot of work to implement by yourself on top of
                Stripe. You need to keep track of all of these entitlements in
                your own DB and deal with renewals, expiry, ad-hoc grants, etc.
                It's definitely doable, especially with AI coding, but you'll
                probably end up building something fragile and hard to maintain.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is just a high-level overview of what the library is
                capable of. It also supports seat-level credits, monetary
                wallets (with micro-cent precision), auto top-ups, robust
                failure recovery, tax collection, invoices, and an
                out-of-the-box pricing table.
              </p>

                I vibe-coded a little toy app for testing:
                <a href="https://snw-test.vercel.app"
                  >https://snw-test.vercel.app</a
                >. There's no validation so feel free to sign up with a dummy
                email, then subscribe to a plan with a test card: 4242 4242 4242
                4242, any future expiry, any 3-digit CVV.
              </p>

                Most AI agent frameworks target code. Write code, run tests, fix
                errors, repeat. That works because code has a natural
                verification signal. It works or it doesn't.
              </p>
              <p>This SDK treats knowledge work like an engineering problem:</p>
              <p>
                Task → Brief → Rubric (hidden from executor) → Work → Verify →
                Fail? → Retry → Pass → Submit
              </p>
              <p>
                The orchestrator coordinates subagents, web search, code
                execution, and file I/O. then checks its own work against
                criteria it can't game (the rubric is generated in a separate
                call and the executor never sees it directly).
              </p>
              <p>
                We originally built this as a harness for RL training on
                knowledge tasks. The rubric is the reward function. If you're
                training models on knowledge work, the
                brief→rubric→execute→verify loop gives you a structured reward
                signal for tasks that normally don't have one.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes Knowledge work different from code? (apart from
                feedback loop) I believe there is some functionality missing
                from today's agents when it comes to knowledge work. I tried to
                include that in this release. Example:
              </p>
              <p>
                Explore mode: Mapping the solution space, identifying the set
                level gaps, and giving options.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most agents optimize for a single answer, and end up with a
                median one. For strategy, design, creative problems, you want to
                see the options, what are the tradeoffs, and what can you do?
                Explore mode generates N distinct approaches, each with explicit
                assumptions and counterfactuals ("this works if X, breaks if
                Y"). The output ends with set-level gaps ie what angles the
                entire set missed. The gaps are often more valuable than the
                takes. I think this is what many of us do on a daily basis, but
                no agent directly captures it today. See
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/explore_mode.py"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/explore_...</a
                >
                and the output for a sense of how this is different.
              </p>
              <p>
                Checkpointing: With many ai agents and especially multi agent
                systems, i can see where it went wrong, but cant run inference
                from same stage. (or you may want multiple explorations once an
                agent has done some tasks like search and is now looking at
                ideas). I used this for rollouts a lot, and think its a great
                feature to run again, or fork from a specific checkpoint.
              </p>
              <p>
                A note on Verification loop: The verify step is where the real
                leverage is. A model that can accurately assess its own work
                against a rubric is more valuable than one that generates
                slightly better first drafts. The rubric makes quality legible —
                to the agent, to the human, and potentially to a training
                signal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some things i like about this: - You can pass a remote execution
                environment (including your browser as a sandbox) and it would
                work. It can be docker, e2b, your local env, anything, the model
                will execute commands in your context, and will iterate based on
                feedback loop. Code execution is a protocol here.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Tool calling: I realize you don't need complex functions.
                Models are good at writing terminal code, and can iterate based
                on feedback, so you can just pass either functions in context
                and model will execute or you can pass docs and model will write
                the code. (same as anthropic's programmatic tool calling).

                >
                - Extensible. See bizarro example where i add a new mode:
                <a

                >
                - working with files:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/with_files.py"

                >
                - this is simple but i love the csv example:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/csv_research_and_calc.py"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/csv_rese...</a
                >
                - remote execution:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/with_custom_executor.py"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/with_cus...</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                And a lot more. This was completely refactored by opus and given
                the rework, probably would have taken a lot of time to release
                it.

                Most AI summarization strips the voices from conversations by
                flattening threads into a wall of text. This kills the joy of
                reading HN discussions. Instead, HN Companion works differently
                - it understands the thread hierarchy, the voting patterns and
                contrasting viewpoints - everything that makes HN interesting.
                Think of it like clustering related discussions across multiple
                hierarchies into a group and surfacing the comments that
                represent each cluster. It keeps the verbatim text with
                backlinks so that you never lose context and can continue the
                conversation from that point. Here is how the summarization
                works under the hood [1].
              </p>
              <p>
                We first built this as an open source browser extension. But
                soon we learned that people hesitate to install it. So we built
                the same experience as a web app with all the features. This
                helped people see how it works, and use it on mobile too (in the
                browser or as PWA). This is now a playground to try new features
                before taking them to the browser extension.
              </p>
              <p>
                We did a Show HN a year ago [2] and we have added these features
                based on user feedback:
              </p>
              <p>
                * cached summaries - summaries are generated and cached on our
                servers. This improved the speed significantly. You still have
                the option to use your own API key or use local models through
                Ollama.
              </p>
              <p>
                * our system prompt is available in the Settings page of the
                extension. You can customize it as you wish.
              </p>
              <p>
                * sort the posts in the feed pages (/home, /show etc.) based on
                points, comments, time or the default sorting order.
              </p>
              <p>
                * We tried fine tuning an open weights model to summarize, but
                learned that with a good system prompt and user prompt, the
                frontier models deliver results of similar quality. So we didn’t
                use the fine-tuned model, but you can run them locally.
              </p>
              <p>
                The browser extension does not track any usage or analytics. The
                code is open source[3].
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to continue to improve HN Companion, specifically add
                features like following an author, notes about an author, draft
                posts etc.

                AI agents that can run tools on your machine are powerful for
                knowledge work, but they’re only as useful as the context they
                have. Rowboat is an open-source, local-first app that turns your
                work into a living knowledge graph (stored as plain Markdown
                with backlinks) and uses it to accomplish tasks on your
                computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, you can say "Build me a deck about our next quarter
                roadmap." Rowboat pulls priorities and commitments from your
                graph, loads a presentation skill, and exports a PDF.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our repo is
                <a href="https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat"
                  >https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat</a
                >, and there’s a demo video here:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>Rowboat has two parts:</p>
              <p>
                (1) A living context graph: Rowboat connects to sources like
                Gmail and meeting notes like Granola and Fireflies, extracts
                decisions, commitments, deadlines, and relationships, and writes
                them locally as linked and editable Markdown files
                (Obsidian-style), organized around people, projects, and topics.
                As new conversations happen (including voice memos), related
                notes update automatically. If a deadline changes in a standup,
                it links back to the original commitment and updates it.
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) A local assistant: On top of that graph, Rowboat includes an
                agent with local shell access and MCP support, so it can use
                your existing context to actually do work on your machine. It
                can act on demand or run scheduled background tasks. Example:
                “Prep me for my meeting with John and create a short voice
                brief.” It pulls relevant context from your graph and can
                generate an audio note via an MCP tool like ElevenLabs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why not just search transcripts? Passing gigabytes of email,
                docs, and calls directly to an AI agent is slow and lossy. And
                search only answers the questions you think to ask. A system
                that accumulates context over time can track decisions,
                commitments, and relationships across conversations, and surface
                patterns you didn't know to look for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rowboat is Apache-2.0 licensed, works with any LLM (including
                local ones), and stores all data locally as Markdown you can
                read, edit, or delete at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our previous startup was acquired by Coinbase, where part of my
                work involved graph neural networks. We're excited to be working
                with graph-based systems again. Work memory feels like the
                missing layer for agents.
              </p>

                It turned out things get messy when your software is running in
                places you can't simply SSH into.

                Over the last year, we’ve also helped modernize a lot of
                home-baked solutions: bash scripts that email when updates fail,
                Excel sheets nobody trusts to track customer versions, engineers
                driving to customer sites to fix things in person, debug
                sessions over email (“can you take a screenshot of the logs and
                send it to me?”), customers with access to internal AWS or GCP
                registries because there was no better option, and deployments
                two major versions behind that nobody wants to touch.

                We waited a year before making our first breaking change, which
                led to a major SemVer update—but it was eventually necessary. We
                needed to completely rewrite how we manage customer
                organizations. In Distr, we differentiate between vendors and
                customers. A vendor is typically the author of a software / AI
                application that wants to distribute it to customers.
                Previously, we had taken a shortcut where every customer was
                just a single user who owned a deployment. We’ve now introduced
                customer organizations. Vendors onboard customer organizations
                onto the platform, and customers own their internal user
                management, including RBAC. This change obviously broke our API,
                and although the migration for our cloud customers was smooth,
                custom solutions built on top of our APIs needed updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other notable features we’ve implemented since our first launch:
              </p>
              <p>
                - An OCI container registry built on an adapted version of
                <a href="https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/"
                  >https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/</a
                >, directly embedded into our codebase and served via a separate
                port from a single Docker image. This allows vendors to
                distribute Docker images and other OCI artifacts if customers
                want to self-manage deployments.
              </p>
              <p>
                - License Management to restrict which customers can access
                which applications or artifact versions. Although “license
                management” is a broadly used term, the main purpose here is to
                codify contractual agreements between vendors and customers. In
                its simplest form, this is time-based access to specific
                software versions, which vendors can now manage with Distr.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Container logs and metrics you can actually see without SSH
                access. Internally, we debated whether to use a time-series
                database or store all logs in Postgres. Although we had to
                tinker quite a bit with Postgres indexes, it now runs stably.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Secret Management, so database passwords don’t show up in
                configuration steps or logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distr is now used by 200+ vendors, including Fortune 500
                companies, across on-prem, GovCloud, AWS, and GCP, spanning
                health tech, fintech, security, and AI companies. We’ve also
                started working on our first air-gapped environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Distr 3.0, we’re working on native Terraform / OpenTofu and
                Zarf support to provision and update infrastructure in
                customers’ cloud accounts and physical environments—empowering
                vendors to offer BYOC and air-gapped use cases, all from a
                single platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distr is fully open source and self-hostable:

              <p>
                I live in the CLI, but for discovery and ongoing monitoring, I
                kept bouncing between tools, terminals, and mental context
                switches. I wanted something faster and more visual, without
                losing technical depth — so I built a GUI that brings my
                favorite diagnostics together in one place.
              </p>
              <p>
                About three months ago, I shared an early version here and got a
                ton of great feedback. I listened: a new name (it was
                PingStalker), a longer trial, and a lot of new features. Today
                I’m excited to share NetViews 2.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                NetViews started because I wanted to know if something on the
                network was scanning my machine. Once I had that, I wanted quick
                access to core details—external IP, Wi-Fi data, and local
                topology. Then I wanted more: fast, reliable scans using ARP
                tables and ICMP.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a Wi-Fi engineer, I couldn’t stop there. I kept adding ways
                to surface what’s actually going on behind the scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Discovery &amp; Scanning: * ARP, ICMP, mDNS, and DNS discovery
                to enumerate every device on your subnet (IP, MAC, vendor, open
                ports). * Fast scans using ARP tables first, then ICMP, to avoid
                the usual “nmap wait”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wireless Visibility: * Detailed Wi-Fi connection performance and
                signal data. * Visual and audible tools to quickly locate the
                access point you’re associated with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Monitoring &amp; Timelines: * Connection and ping timelines over
                1, 2, 4, or 8 hours. * Continuous “live ping” monitoring to
                visualize latency spikes, packet loss, and reconnects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Low-level Traffic (but only what matters): * Live capture of
                DHCP, ARP, 802.1X, LLDP/CDP, ICMP, and off-subnet chatter. *
                mDNS decoded into human-readable output (this took months of
                deep dives).
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, it’s written in Swift. It uses low-level BSD
                sockets for ICMP and ARP, Apple’s Network framework for
                interface enumeration, and selectively wraps existing
                command-line tools where they’re still the best option. The
                focus has been on speed and low overhead.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d love feedback from anyone who builds or uses network
                diagnostic tools: - Does this fill a gap you’ve personally hit
                on macOS? - Are there better approaches to scan speed or event
                visualization that you’ve used? - What diagnostics do you still
                find yourself dropping to the CLI for?
              </p>

                <a href="https://netviews.app">https://netviews.app</a> There’s
                a free trial and paid licenses; I’m funding development directly
                rather than ads or subscriptions. Licenses include free
                upgrades.
