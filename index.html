                Pop is a Text-based User Interface (TUI) that allows you to send
                emails without having to switch context from your command-line
                interface.
              </p>
              <p>Here's why I'm obsessed with Pop:</p>
              <p>1. You can write an email body with AI</p>
              <p>2. You can easily install using Homebrew</p>
              <p>
                3. You can do some really powerful stuff like generating a PDF
                and sending an invoice via email entirely from the command line
              </p>
              <p>
                The email sending part is taken care by Resend, another
                developer-first product, which makes it the perfect integration
                for this.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a developer, I live in the terminal. And I would love to hear
                how other developers feel about this. We would love to hear your
                ideas, experiences, and feedback.

              <a href="https://grai.io">https://grai.io</a>), an open-source
              data observability platform. It helps prevent production data
              outages by evaluating changes to your data pipelines in CI, rather
              than at runtime.
              <p>
                Ever experienced a production outage due to changes in upstream
                data sources? That's a problem we regularly encountered whether
                deploying machine learning or keeping a datawarehouse
                operational and it led us to create Grai.
              </p>
              <p>
                Systematically testing the impact of data changes on the rest of
                your stack turns out to be quite difficult when the same data is
                copied and used across many different services and applications.
                Simple changes like renaming a column in a database can result
                in broken BI dashboards, incorrect training data for ML models,
                and data pipeline failure. For example, business users regularly
                deal with questions like "why does revenue look different in
                different dashboards".
              </p>
              <p>
                These sort of problems are commonly dealt with by passively
                monitoring application execution logs for anomalies that might
                indicate an outage. Our goal was to move that task out of
                runtime where an outage has already occurred back into testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                At its core, Grai is a graph of the relationships between the
                data in your organization, from columns in a database to JSON
                fields in an API. This graph allows Grai to analyze the
                downstream impact of proposed changes during CI and before they
                go live.
              </p>
              <p>
                It includes a variety of pre-built integrations with common data
                tools such as PostgreSQL, Snowflake, dbt, and Fivetran, which
                automatically extract metadata and synchronize the state of your
                graph. It's built on a flexible data model backed by REST and
                GraphQL APIs and a Python client library. This way, users can
                directly build on top of Grai as they see fit. For example,
                because every object in Grai serializes to a yaml definition
                file, sort of like a CRD in Kubernetes, even if a pre-built
                integration doesn't exist it's fairly easy to manually create or
                script a custom solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                We made the decision to build open-source from the beginning in
                part because we believe lineage is underutilized both
                organizationally and technologically. We hope to provide a
                foundation for the community to build cool concepts on top and
                have already had companies come to us with amazing ideas, like
                optimizing their real-time query pipelines to take advantage of
                spot price arbitrage between cloud and on-prem.
              </p>
              <p>
                We try not to be overly opinionated about how organizations
                work, so whether you maintain a development database or run
                service containers in GitHub Actions it doesn't really matter.
                When your tests are triggered we evaluate the new state of the
                environment and check for any impacts, before reporting back as
                a comment in the pull request.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data observability can have unexpected benefits. One of our
                customers uses us because we make on-boarding new engineers
                easier. Because we render an infinitely zoomable Figma-like
                graph of the entire data stack it's possible for them to
                visually explore end-to-end data flows and application
                dependencies.
