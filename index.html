                Maelstrom is a suite of tools for running tests in hermetic
                micro-containers locally on your machine or distributed across
                arbitrarily large clusters. Maelstrom currently has test runners
                for Rust and Python, with more on the way. You might use
                Maelstrom to run your tests because:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  * It's easy. Maelstrom functions as a drop-in replacement for cargo test and pytest. In most cases, it just works with your existing tests with minimal configuration.
  * It's reliable. Maelstrom runs every test hermetically in its own lightweight container, eliminating confusing errors caused by inter-test or implicit test-environment dependencies.
  * It's scalable. Maelstrom can be run as a cluster. You can add more worker machines to linearly increase test throughput.
  * It's clean. Maelstrom has built a rootless container implementation (not relying on Docker or RunC) from scratch, in Rust, optimized to be low-overhead and start quickly.
  * It's fast. In most cases, Maelstrom is faster than cargo test, even without using clustering. Maelstrom’s test-per-process model is inherently slower than pytest’s shared-process model, but Maelstrom provides test isolation at a low performance cost.
</code></pre>
              While our focus thus far has been on running tests, Maelstrom's
              underlying job execution system is general-purpose. We provide a
              command line utility to run arbitrary commands, as well a
              gRPC-based API and Rust bindings for programmatic access and
              control.
              <p>
                Feedback and questions are welcome! Thanks for giving it a
                whirl.

                monitors how developers interact with your app and automatically
                generates and maintains test coverage nearing 100%. Even for the
                most complex applications. All without needing to write or
                maintain a single test.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our customers find it increases their end-to-end frontend
                development velocity by over 20%. If you’ve ever had the rare
                chance of working on a project where you can have near 100%
                confidence in your changes before you hit merge you’ll
                understand this immediately: programming feels completely
                different in that environment. Every dev can refactor with
                complete confidence and speed. And so they do, keeping the code
                fresh &amp; nimble. Our customers’s developers have been able to
                move faster than they’ve often ever experienced before.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re growing rapidly, and want to provide this experience to
                every software company in the world — while freeing them of the
                burden of writing or maintaining tests. We’ve built a team of
                exclusively world-class software engineers (“One of the
                strongest teams that I have seen” - Jared Friedman, Partner at Y
                Combinator).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you join us we’ll promise you’ll learn faster than you ever
                have in your career, and will be able to fundamentally change
                how the world develops software.
              </p>
              <p>## How does Meticulous work?</p>
              <p>
                You add a script tag on localhost and internal stacks, and
                Meticulous records all the development teams daily interactions
                with the app as they develop features. Meticulous understands
                every line of code, component and route executed by each flow
                and uses this to maintain a visual snapshot test suite that
                covers close to 100% of your code. This suite tests your apps
                UI, user flows and logic at all layers, across all edge cases,
                all branches, all feature flags. As your app evolves, your test
                suite evolves.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tests are executed in an environment that ensures full
                determinism from the lowest level, right down to how the
                browsers’ macro &amp; micro-tasks are scheduled — so no flakes.
                This bedrock of determinism is what makes the full system
                possible.

              <p>## What’s our team like?</p>
              <p>
                We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team
                previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir, GitHub and
                Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at
                these companies. We are backed by some of the best founders and
                technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch
                (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub),
                Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment),
                Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch
                of other incredible folks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an
                entire category of products to build on top of replay. This
                ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance
                impact of frontend code.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to change the way the world develops software, and
                influence software approaches for decades to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding
                engineer to join our team of six. We sponsor visas.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here
                are a few problems you might work on:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of
                sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds. -
                Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains
                determinism. - Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover
                differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that
                are too similar. - Help build out a team of world-class, highly
                collaborative, software engineers.
              </p>
              <p>
                As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build
                the culture and technology from the ground up.
              </p>
              <p>What we look for:</p>
              <p>
                In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with,
                combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We
                also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each
                other; we win as a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level
                skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have
                strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software
                engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code,
                Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc.
                or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value
                transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong
                desire to become the best engineer you can be.
              </p>

                engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think
                will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship,
                if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running
                100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech
                companies).
              </p>
              <p>
                You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there
                are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and
                deliver something that transforms how software is built.

                Does anyone know how Chrome and Chromium achieve this audio
                isolation?
              </p>

                Given that Chromium is open source, it would be helpful if
                someone could point me to the specific part of the codebase that
                handles this. Any insights or technical details would be greatly

              As engineers, our experience with traditional tools like Jira
              hasn't been great. It is slow, bloated and often acts as a burden
              to engineers. These tools didn't help engineers in getting the
              work done faster, they only helped the management in tracking the
              work which enabled a lot of processes and micro-management which
              used to kill our productivity.
              <p>
                With the rise of LLMs, we thought about how project management
                and issue tracking would look 5-10 years from now. The current
                tools didn't match our vision, which excited us and started the
                journey of Tegon. We aim to build a tool where manual workflows
                are either automated or handled by AI. This tool will provide
                better context about a task to an engineer by smartly gathering
                data from all sources, helping teams with better prioritization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tegon loads all the data from local (indexed db) thus making it
                super fast to load and navigate. We make all of this happen by
                real-time sync in the background. Tegon also uses AI to simplify
                the issue-creation process by automatically creating titles,
                suggesting labels and assignees and identifying duplicates.
                Tegon also simplifies the issue creation process from Slack,
                just apply an emoji to a Slack message and a tegon issue will be
                created making it easier for other teams to raise bugs or
                feature requests to engineering teams.
              </p>
              <p>
                We deeply value the feedback from this community and have spent
                the last month revamping Tegon's design based on the feedback
                from our last launch. We just got started and there's a lot more
                to come. We're eager to get more feedback and keep building. Let
                us know what you think in the comments :)

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I've been writing 2 blogs for the past couple of years, one
                focused on Software Engineering and the other on general life
                things (e.g. philosophy, psychology, self-improvement, etc).
                Recently, I've created another blog focused on Entrepreneurship.
                At the moment, they all live on their own domains.
              </p>
              <p>
                My purpose in writing the blogs is (1) I really enjoy writing,
                and (2) I want to build a personal brand (all of my blogs
                mention my name, and each link to another). However, it's
                becoming hard to maintain the blogs. They each run their own
                instance of the software, meaning any change I make in terms of
                design/security fixes/SEO/etc, needs to be replicated to other
                blogs (where applicable). I need to keep separate contact emails
                per blog, and in general this setup is too complicated, thus
                discouraging me from writing. Moreover, building domain
                authority is hard, since every blog essentially starts from 0.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also own a domain for my name. It shows some about me
                information and links to all the blogs. I was considering
                consolidating all the 3 blogs into one under my domain name, and
                do a 301 redirect from the old domains to the new one (I don't
                mind owning the domains for some time, as links to them are
                circulating on the web already). This will eliminate the hassle
                of bootstrapping and managing each blog individually.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to keep proper audience segmentations, I could create a
                high level category and put each blog into its own category (for
                example, as subdirectory
                `https://examples.com/blog/category/software-engineering`). I
                doubt many people check the blogs themselves, and most traffic
                is coming from me sharing links to new content, or people
                searching for a particular thing that is indexed by Google, thus
                leading to a specific blog post. But even if there are people
                who read the blogs by RSS or check the website directly, they
                still can use dedicated RSS per category, or just access a
                domain with subdirectory for the category.
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that it will probably hurt SEO in the beginning,
                but I'm fine with that. It can also lead to some readers
                churning, however with proper categorization I don't see a
                reason why (things like "similar posts" or "next/previous" could
                be category segmented, thus creating the illusion that the
                reader still reads a blog about, say, software engineering).
              </p>
              <p>
                What are your thoughts about it? Am I missing something? Is it a
                good or a bad plan?
