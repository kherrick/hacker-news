              <a href="https://integuru.ai">https://integuru.ai</a>). We build
              low-latency integrations with platforms lacking official APIs. We
              take custom requests and manage creation, hosting, and
              authentication. To automate our work, we built an open-source AI
              agent that reverse-engineers internal APIs to generate integration
              code. Here’s a demo:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJ4w5BCpQ0"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJ4w5BCpQ0</a
              >.
              <p>
                Many products need integrations with third-party services, but
                platforms often lack official APIs. Examples include logistics
                software, financial services, electronic health records (EHRs),
                and government websites. To build low-latency integrations,
                developers must reverse-engineer internal APIs, but this can get
                complicated. With Integuru, you can have easier access to
                integrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started as recent college grads trying to make US income tax
                data accessible. We contacted banks, brokerages, payroll
                software, and more to request access to their APIs, but none
                took us seriously. We resorted to building integrations with
                these systems to extract documents like W-2s and 1099s. We
                initially used browser automation but ran into two big problems:
                our integrations (1) weren’t reliable due to changing UIs and
                (2) had slow execution speeds due to spinning up browsers and
                waiting for pages to load. We experimented with AI-based
                automation maintenance, but it didn’t solve slow speeds. So, we
                concluded that browser automation is useful when execution speed
                isn’t essential, but reverse engineering is often the only path
                for performant integrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through reverse-engineering dozens of platforms, we noticed many
                internal API design patterns that LLMs could decipher. We built
                an agent to automate the creation of integrations. Today,
                Integuru can analyze a platform’s internal API designs and build
                an integration in minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The agent mimics what a human does when reverse-engineering. Say
                you want to download utility bills from a utility website. You’d
                first use Integuru to generate a file of network requests and a
                file of cookies. You pair these two files with a prompt about
                your desired action—in this case, to download utility bills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Integuru identifies the final request that downloads utility
                bills. The request URL might look like this:
                <a
                  href="https://www.example.com/utility-bills?accountId=123&amp;userId=456"
                  >https://www.example.com/utility-bills?accountId=123&amp;userId=4...</a
                >. It then identifies parts of the request that depend on other
                requests. The example URL contains dynamic parts— accountId and
                userId—that usually are in the response of previous request(s).
                It then finds other requests whose response contains any of
                these and adds them to the dependency graph. The newly found
                request URLs might look like
                <a href="https://www.example.com/getAccountId"
                  >https://www.example.com/getAccountId</a
                >,
                <a href="https://www.example.com/getUserId"
                  >https://www.example.com/getUserId</a
                >, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                This process repeats until the most recently found request
                doesn’t depend on any other request. Integuru then traverses up
                the graph, starting from the requests without dependencies while
                converting each request into a runnable function.
              </p>
              <p>
                Integuru supports a surprising number of use cases like
                downloading documents, sending money, creating virtual cards…
                People already use the agent to build low-latency APIs for
                platforms like Robinhood, transportation management systems
                (TMS), and more. However, the agent still has limitations due to
                current LLM capabilities and long-tail edge cases, but we’ve
                been giving each platform to the agent for the first try. When
                the agent does struggle, we find the generated graphs and code
                still helpful as references for us to complete the work
                manually.
              </p>
              <p>
                The agent and all integrations are open-source under AGPL-3.0.
                We charge for services to (1) build custom integrations when the
                agent struggles or for your convenience, (2) handle hosting, and
                (3) manage authentication using authentication cookies from
                authenticated browser sessions. We charge per API call with an
                implementation fee for new platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re currently working to increase the agent’s coverage and
                improve code generation. We will continue to iterate and want to
                one day allow developers to integrate with all platforms
                instantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Integuru is still an early effort. We’re passionate about
                automating integrations and would love your feedback!

                Here is an example of the QR code I have on my door. You can
                scan it and say hello:

              <p>
                This was also a great excuse to build my first app for Android
                and iPhone.

                I’d love to get some feedback before I spend more time polishing
                the app. Please try it out and feel free to ask me any

                It's a C++ pub-sub framework (a lot like ROS, in that way), but
                rather than declaring C++ publishers/subscribers directly, you
                declare the topics and types your code cares about in a
                configuration file, along with conditions on those inputs. Doing
                this allows for deep knowledge about the code running, which
                unlocks the possibility of deterministic simulation and testing
                (along with making it easy to generate bindings for other
                languages, create alternate schedulers, more easily swap out
                internal concepts, etc). It also enables easy static analysis of
                the codebase - given a launch file and arguments to the launch
                file, one can analyze the topic network and find missing
                publishers or publishers that publish to nothing.

              <a href="https://trench.dev">https://trench.dev</a>). It's open
              source analytics infrastructure for tracking events, page views,
              and identifying users, and it's built on top of ClickHouse and
              Kafka.
              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/frigadehq/trench"
                  >https://github.com/frigadehq/trench</a

              <p>
                I built Trench because the Postgres table we used for tracking
                events at our startup (<a href="http://frigade.com/"
                  >http://frigade.com/</a
                >) was getting expensive and becoming a performance bottleneck
                as we scaled to millions of end users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many companies run into the same problem as us (e.g. Stripe,
                Heroku:
                <a href="https://brandur.org/fragments/events"
                  >https://brandur.org/fragments/events</a
                >). They often start by adding a basic events table to their
                relational database, which works at first, but can become an
                issue as the application scales. It’s usually the biggest table
                in the database, the slowest one to query, and the longest one
                to back up.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Trench, we’ve put together a single Docker image that gives
                you a production-ready tracking event table built for scale and
                speed. When we migrated our tracking table from Postgres to
                Trench, we saw a 42% reduction in cost to serve on our primary
                Postgres cluster and all lag spikes from autoscaling under high
                traffic were eliminated.
              </p>
              <p>Here are some of the core features:</p>
              <p>
                * Fully compliant with the Segment tracking spec e.g. track(),
                identify(), group(), etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Can handle thousands of events per second on a single node
              </p>
              <p>
                * Query tracking data in real-time with read-after-write
                guarantees
              </p>
              <p>* Send data anywhere with throttled and batched webhooks</p>
              <p>
                * Single production-ready docker image. No need to manage and
                roll your own Kafka/ClickHouse/Nodejs/etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Easily plugs into any cloud hosted ClickHouse and Kafka
                solutions e.g. ClickHouse Cloud, Confluent
              </p>
              <p>
                Trench can be used for a range of use cases. Here are some
                possibilities:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting: Set up real-time alerts
                and monitoring for your services by tracking custom events like
                errors, usage spikes, or specific user actions and sending that
                data anywhere with Trench’s webhooks
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Event Replay and Debugging: Capture all user interactions in
                real-time for event replay
              </p>
              <p>
                3. A/B Testing Platform: Capture events from different users and
                groups in real time. Segment users by querying in real time and
                serve the right experiences to the right users
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Product Analytics for SaaS Applications: Embed Trench into
                your existing SaaS product to power user audit logs or tracking
                scripts on your end-users’ websites
              </p>
              <p>
                5. Build a custom RAG model: Easily query event data and give
                users answers in real-time. LLMs are really good at writing SQL
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is open-source and MIT-licensed. If there’s
                interest, we’re thinking about adding support for Elastic
                Search, direct data integrations (e.g. Redshift, S3, etc.), and
                an admin interface for creating queries, webhooks, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Have you experienced the same issues with your events tables?
                I'd love to hear what HN thinks about the project.

                I'm looking for a simple app that can listen for English,
                translate into Korean (and other languages), then perform speech
                synthesis on the translation. Basically, a Babelfish that
                doesn't stick in the ear. Although real-time would be great, a
                max 5-second delay is manageable.
              </p>
              <p>
                RTranslator is awkward (couldn't get it to perform
                speech-to-speech using a single phone). 3PO sprouts errors like
                dandelions and requires an online connection.
              </p>
              <p>Any suggestions?</p>
