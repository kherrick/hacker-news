              <p>
                I did build quite a few data warehouses both for the companies I
                worked at, as well as for consultancy projects. One of the more
                common pain points I observed was that everyone had to rebuild
                the same data ingestion bit over and over again, and each in
                different ways:
              </p>
              <p>
                - some wrote code for the ingestion from scratch to various
                degrees
              </p>
              <p>
                - some used off-the-shelf data ingestion tools like Fivetran /
                Airbyte
              </p>
              <p>
                I have always disliked both of these approaches, for different
                reasons, but never got around to working on what I'd imagine to
                be the better way forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solutions that required writing code for copying the data
                had quite a bit of overhead such as how to generalize them, what
                language/library to use, where to deploy, how to monitor, how to
                schedule, etc. I ended up figuring out solutions for each of
                these matters, but the process always felt suboptimal. I like
                coding but for more novel stuff rather than trying to copy a
                table from Postgres to BigQuery. There are libraries like dlt
                (awesome lib btw, and awesome folks!) but that still required me
                to write, deploy, and maintain the code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then there are solutions like Fivetran or Airbyte, where there's
                a UI and everything is managed through there. While it is nice
                that I didn't have to write code for copying the data, I still
                had to either pay some unknown/hard-to-predict amount of money
                to these vendors or host Airbyte myself which is roughly back to
                square zero (for me, since I want to maintain the least amount
                of tech myself). Nothing was versioned, people were changing
                things in the UI and breaking the connectors, and what worked
                yesterday didn't work today.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had a bit of spare time a couple of weeks ago and I wanted to
                take a stab at the problem. I have been thinking of
                standardizing the process for quite some time already, and dlt
                had some abstractions that allowed me to quickly prototype a CLI
                that copies data from one place to another. I made a few
                decisions (that I hope I won't regret in the future):
              </p>
              <p>
                - everything is a URI: every source and every destination is
                represented as a URI
              </p>
              <p>
                - there can be only one thing copied at a time: it'll copy only
                a single table within a single command, not a full database with
                an unknown amount of tables
              </p>
              <p>
                - incremental loading is a must, but doesn't have to be super
                flexible: I decided to support full-refresh, append-only, merge,
                and delete+insert incremental strategies, because I believe this
                covers 90% of the use-cases out there.
              </p>
              <p>
                - it is CLI-only, and can be configured with flags &amp; env
                variables so that it can be automated quickly, e.g. drop it into
                GitHub Actions and run it daily.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result ended up being `ingestr` (<a
                  href="https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr"
                  >https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                I am pretty happy with how the first version turned out, and I
                plan to add support for more sources &amp; destinations. ingestr
                is built to be flexible with various source and destination
                combinations, and I plan to introduce more non-DB sources such
                as Notion, GSheets, and custom APIs that return JSON (which I am
                not sure how exactly I'll do but open to suggestions!).
              </p>
              <p>
                To be perfectly clear: I don't think ingestr covers 100% of data
                ingestion/copying needs out there, and it doesn't aim that. My
                goal with it is to cover most scenarios with a decent set of
                trade-offs so that common scenarios can be solved easily without
                having to write code or manage infra. There will be more complex
                needs that require engineering effort by others, and that's
                fine.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd love to hear your feedback on how can ingestr help data
                copying needs better, looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
              </p>

              <p>
                I’ve written a good 25+ webapps over the last few years in
                almost every major framework under the sun. Python and React
                remain my favorite. They let you get started quickly and grow to
                scale. But the developer experience of linking these two worlds
                remains less than optimal:
              </p>
              <p>
                — Sharing typehints and schemas across frontend and backend code
              </p>
              <p>
                — Scattered fetch() calls to template data and modify server
                objects
              </p>
              <p>— Server side rendering / gateway support</p>
              <p>— Error handling on frontend fetches</p>
              <p>
                Mountaineer is an attempt to solve those problems. I didn’t want
                to re-invent the wheel of what Python and React are good at, so
                it’s relatively light on syntax. It provides one frontend hook
                for React apps and introduces a MVC convention on the backend
                for managing views. Support files are generated progressively
                through a local watcher, so IDE type-hints and function calls
                work out of the box.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s more intuitive to explain with some code, so pop over to
                the Github if you’re interested in this stack and taking a look:
