              <p>
                I've been "funemployed" for a few months and with all that free
                time and idle hands I wrote a full web framework (think Rails,
                not Flask) for Rust.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's boring old MVC, has its own ORM, templates, background
                jobs, auth, websockets, migrations and more. If you're keen but
                don't feel like rewriting your app in a different language, Rwf
                has a WSGI server to run Django (or Flask) inside Rust [1],
                letting you migrate to Rust at your own pace without disrupting
                your website.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think Rust makes a great prototyping and deploy straight to
                production language. Now it has yet another framework for y'all
                to play with.
              </p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

                countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no

                We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming
                is not just a job but it's something they love to do. We're
                obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases,
                compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does
                this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have
                a fully-automated development environment and be pushing commits
                on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple
                times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Our codebase is
                written in Python, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, Rust, and Nix. To
                start working on our codebase, you'll need to be familiar with
                Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.
              </p>

                We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate
                three datacenters with high performance servers we've built that
                are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process.
                We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do
                full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis
                on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are
                published. Unlike a typical company where you'll spend half of
                your time in meetings— at MixRank you'll get to direct your
                entire focus into difficult technical problems that will help
                you to grow as an individual.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't
                singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy
                on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the
                position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom
                role and responsibilities that are specialized to their
                interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of
                specific requirements for a position with the expectation that
                you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be
                the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements
                decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first
                get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then
                we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific
                talents.

              <p>
                We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of
                professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity
                exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.
                This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse
                opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases,
                distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis,
                machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data
                mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight
                what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side
                projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ideally you've already finished with school, but if you still
                have one or more years left please feel free to apply anyway. If
                you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to
                accommodate your schedule.

                Data Formulator blends UI interaction with natural language so
                that you can create visualizations with AI much more
                effectively!
              </p>
              <p>You can:</p>
              <p>
                * create rich visualizations beyond initial datasets, where AI
                helps transforming and visualizing data along the way
              </p>
              <p>
                * iterate your designs and dive deeper using data threads, a new
                way to manage your conversation with AI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is a demo video:
