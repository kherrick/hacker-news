              we were thinking how to preserve the 25 years of valuable DPReview
              camera data. Archive.org has been great, but it's not usable by
              the general public.
              <p>
                The best way to keep it safe going forward, is to have the
                community own it, so we open sourced it:
                <a href="https://github.com/open-product-data/digital-cameras"
                  >https://github.com/open-product-data/digital-cameras</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm aware of a number of attempts to make product data
                open-sourced, but none have the power of the photo geeks behind
                it :)

              <p>
                I made a tool that autogenerates simple, high-level explanations
                of concepts and organizes them in a somewhat university
                course-like structure so that it's easier to see how things are
                structured. Currently it has about 20,000 concepts on a range of
                topics but that's just what I generated so far, it should work
                with more obscure topics in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love learning about random topics where I don't have a good
                background in like history or linguistics, but it's hard to
                figure out what topics there (you don't know what you don't
                know) are in certain fields and what they are even about, so
                this was a way to get the high level idea about random things
                that I wanted to know about.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also only uses the information in the GPT model at the
                moment, so obviously information can't be trusted completely and
                you should definitely double check any information you read here
                by Googling. I'm thinking of doing the Bing Chat approach for
                the next version and adding references, but don't have that yet
              </p>
              <p>
                Hopefully someone else finds this useful even if it's not
                perfect!

                About me: I spent 15 years designing stamping dies on a high end
                cad system. During that time, I also developed and marketed
                extensions/plugins toward that cad system. Through that
                experience, I came disillusioned with 'vendor lock-in' and
                proprietary software in general. I basically retired, took the
                vow of poverty and moved all my computing to open source. I have
                since, and continue to, try and improve the open source cad
                environment.

              <a href="https://www.goinri.com/">https://www.goinri.com/</a>), an
              investment platform for Indian expats to diversify capital in
              India, without any taxation or repatriation hassles. Super excited
              to be launching on HN, the platform that I personally nerd on and
              has helped me discover some of my favorite products early.
              <p>
                My cofounder Hemant (@hemantgangolia) has been living in the US
                since 6 years and has tried multiple times to invest in India.
                He couldn't go ahead with the process because bank account
                opening was a challenge and the process after that wasn't clear.
                There is complexity around taxation, moving money back and a
                general lack of clarity on where to invest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though there are currently over 30 million Indian expats
                globally, there are no digital, full-service solutions offered
                for them specifically. US solutions focus only on US investments
                and Indian solutions focus only on Indian customersâ€”this makes
                the India &lt;&gt; US belt underserved. Indian banks with
                overseas branches offer these services, but investors donâ€™t
                trust these banks because of conflict of interest. There are
                other small players in the market but they expect customers to
                do their own service, which is not what customers want, based on
                our learnings.
              </p>
              <p>
                We found a lot of other Indian expats in the same situation as
                us - wanting to invest in India for financial and emotional
                reasons, but unable to do so easily or consistently. We wished a
                simple product existed to solve for this online. We couldnâ€™t
                find one, so we built it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inri is like Wealthfront for your India investments. It is a web
                platform that offers curated mutual fund portfolios and solves
                for all tax compliance and repatriation needs online. We have
                curated the funds based on performance, history and compliance
                based on your resident country, and funds are selected based on
                your risk preference, similarly to Wealthfront. We facilitate
                investments through central platforms like National Stock
                Exchange and show the holdings via a dashboard on the platform
                once the investments are done. Additionally, we do this while
                making tax compliance and repatriation easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just log in to the platform, upload your documents, approve the
                emails with details confirmation and youâ€™re sorted. Currently,
                only people with a PAN card (Indian financial identity document)
                can invest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our early customers are all people who have tried doing this
                before, but gave up because of all the hassle. The fact that
                they could get invested in just 2 days vs weeks for traditional
                alternatives was unheard of to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know this is a bit of a niche product for HN but we also know
                that there are quite a few Indian expats like us here, who could
                make use of itâ€”and we hope it makes interesting enough reading
                for everybody else. We would love to get your feedback! Thank
                you!

                With CoScreen 5.0, you can now share your windows from multiple
                displays at the same time, a long standing request by our most
                avid users and impossible in other apps. It also has a
                lightning-fast, Rust-based window compositing, scaling, and
                streaming engine now.
              </p>
              <p>
                CoScreen was always meant to be different so that you and your
                team can share your screens simultaneously and
                multi-directionally, and to be able to control what is being
                shared. We saw it as a natural extension and closely coupled
                with your OS â€” instant, fast, and seamless. A better way to pair
                program, debug tough incidents, or jam on great ideas by sharing
                multi-modal information like code, commands, graphs, or logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                All that made a lot of sense conceptually but to be frank, it
                was hard to get it right. Now a part of Datadog and with major
                parts of our app rewritten in Rust, we feel weâ€™re closer than
                ever.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hereâ€™s what pair programmers liked about CoScreen, so we made it
                even better: - High definition code sharing: Windows are
                video-streamed in real-time at their native resolution whenever
                possible. You never have to search for your IDE anymore or be
                anxious to share the wrong window. - Multi-directional
                collaboration: You can share, while Alice shares, while Bob
                shares. Side-by-side, across multiple displays. With built-in
                crisp audio and video chat. - 60FPS+ super smooth mouse
                pointers. Type, click, and draw on any shared window as if it
                was your own.
              </p>
              <p>
                What some of you did NOT like, so we fixed it in CoScreen V5: -
                CPU utilization and latency have been reduced drastically as
                various parts of our desktop client are now implemented in Rust,
                building on crates such as cxx, rust-skia, iced, as well as Neon
                for our native remote control plugins. - No more accidental
                clicking into remote windows through the new remote window
                toggles. - Youâ€™re no longer bound by your displays, can share
                windows from multiple of them at the same time and even move
                them across displays while sharing without stopping. - Youâ€™ll
                also soon be able to join meetings from your browser from any
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                CoScreen runs on macOS (x64 and Apple Silicon), Windows, soon
                also on the web and is currently free. Weâ€™re planning to charge
                for larger teams and enterprise features in the future.
                Hopefully - finally - weâ€™ll also have a Linux version one day.
                Tell us if you need it urgently and if you have any other
                requirements!
