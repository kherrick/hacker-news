            <div class="text">
              <p>
                In addition to my studies in computer science, I have been
                working on a side project. I obtain data from the
                Unternehmensregister, a register where every German limited
                company is required to publish their financial statements. These
                statements are published as HTML files and are completely
                unstructured. While financial statements often look similar,
                companies are not required to follow a specific structure, which
                often leads to inconsistently formatted statements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The use of the Unternehmensregister is completely free, so you
                can check out some examples.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wrote code that converts the unstructured financial statements
                into structured data using the ChatGPT API. This works well. Of
                course, there are some problems that have not yet been solved,
                but data extraction works well for the majority of companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                I than coded a Random Forest algorithm to estimate the
                probability of default for a company based on its financial
                statement from the Unternehmensregister. I built a website to
                present the structured data along with the scores. Essentially,
                I create a credit reports for companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, there are four companies in Germany that also create
                credit reports (Schufa, Creditreform, Crif, and Creditsafe).
                Other companies resell the data from these four providers. I
                provide the same services as these companies, but without
                including personal information such as directors or investors.
                The market for this service is quite large; for example,
                Creditreform sold over 26 million credit reports about companies
                in 2020.
              </p>
              <p>
                My probability of default prediction performs quite well,
                achieving an AUC score of 0.87 on my test data. An AUC of 0.87
                means that there is an 87% chance that the model ranks a
                randomly selected company that defaults higher than a randomly
                selected company that does not default. Additionally, there are
                many more companies to crawl for my database.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, I am focusing on companies that are required to
                publish their profit and loss statements. For testing purposes,
                there are currently 2,000 companies available on my website.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the moment, the website is only available in German, but you
                can use Google Translate, which works ok for my website.
              </p>
              <p>Thank you very much for your feedback!</p>

                As a dual major in engineering and finance who started my career
                at a hedge fund, I found it challenging to develop hands-on
                financial modeling skills using existing tools. Platforms like
                Coursera, Udemy, Corporate Finance Institute (CFI), and Wall
                Street Prep (WSP) primarily rely on video-based tutorials. While
                informative, these formats often lack the dynamic, interactive,
                and repetitive practice necessary to build real expertise.
              </p>
              <p>For example, the learning process often involves:</p>
              <p>- Replaying videos multiple times to grasp key concepts.</p>
              <p>- Constantly switching between tutorials and Excel files.</p>
              <p>
                - Dealing with occasional discrepancies between tutorial numbers
                and the provided Excel materials.
              </p>
              <p>
                To solve these problems, I created Quantus—an interactive
                platform where users can learn finance by trying out formulas or
                building financial models directly in an Excel-like environment.
                Inspired by LeetCode, the content is organized into three
                levels—easy, medium, and hard—making it accessible for beginners
                while still challenging for advanced users.
              </p>
              <p>Our growing library of examples includes:</p>
              <p>- 3-statement financial models</p>
              <p>- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis</p>
              <p>- Leveraged Buyouts (LBO)</p>
              <p>- Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A)</p>
              <p>
                Here’s a demo video to showcase the platform in action.

              <p>
                Roughly 4 years ago I started building a lazy functional
                iteration library for JS/TS.
              </p>
              <p>I had a few goals for the library:</p>
              <p>
                - Supporting sync, sequential async, and concurrent async
                iteration
              </p>
              <p>
                - Limiting it to a small number of orthogonal concepts that
                compose beautifully to solve problems
              </p>
              <p>- Making it fully tree-shakeable</p>
              <p>
                I built it for myself and have (mostly) been its only user as I
                refined it. I've used it in lots of personal projects and really
                enjoyed it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I recently decided it would be nice to spread that enjoyment so
                I created a documentation website complete with a playground
                where you can try out the library.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope you enjoy using it as much as I do! Looking forward to
                hearing your thoughts :)

                Robotics is in an interesting place right now, with many
                warehouse automation companies humming along for almost a
                decade, and a lot of new effort going to full general purpose
                hardware with humanoids and software via generalist robotics
                foundation models. We love these efforts (David used to work on
                one at Google X with Everyday Robots), but we also see a lot of
                utility in the current wave of robotics planning and perception
                tech that can enable new use cases today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Airlines in the US compete primarily on efficiency and customer
                loyalty, and baggage handling hits both (John B. has first-hand
                experience from working on baggage optimization projects at
                United Airlines). 2% of flights are delayed by baggage errors,
                leading to downstream network delays. Baggage handling is also a
                major complaint in customer experience—almost everyone has a
                horror story of a missing bag, and sometimes people vow never to
                fly an airline again for losing their belongings. Furthermore,
                it’s a really dangerous job for employees from a repetitive
                stress standpoint. EU regulation is coming to reflect this,
                protecting workers with a maximum number of bags transferred per
                shift to alleviate back and tendon injuries that are inherent to
                this job.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately for airlines, passengers don’t package their
                luggage in nicely uniform cardboard boxes. If they did, then the
                airlines could benefit directly from the recent takeoff in
                manipulator tech for warehouses. But airline luggage is way more
                wacky and irregular. If robots are going to handle it, they need
                to reason about how to grasp each item, handle its
                deformability, stack it in a stable way, and do all of this
                quickly, safely, and reliably.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what we’re tackling at Azalea. We’re bringing our
                expertise in deformable object manipulation, perception, robot
                learning, and planning, to this logistical problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a few strong bets behind what we’re working on: (1) The
                hardware to solve this problem has been available or
                manufacturable for decades, what’s been missing is perception,
                planning, and control. (2) Cobots, robots designed to operate
                alongside humans, aren’t enough for safety. To do this task
                efficiently, you need to move up to 50 kg bags very quickly,
                which can be dangerous no matter how well the cobots are
                designed. Light curtains (arrays of lasers that stop a machine
                when interrupted) and machine cages are the current industrial
                standard and remain the way to go. (3) Software for generalist
                robots needs more data than most people today believe, and it
                will be at least 15 years before deployment: we should focus on
                specialized problems of economic value.
              </p>
              <p>Our core technical developments are in a few areas:</p>
              <p>
                - Grasp synthesis and selection: From visual data only, how can
                we identify good candidate grasp points and rank them? For this,
                we use a mix of physical reasoning, heuristics, and a lot of
                learning from previous data, combined in a single objective
                function. Furthermore, success must be evaluated as both a
                successful grasp and continual hold throughout the transfer.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Placement planning: How do we lay out luggage in the module
                we’re loading? There’s a nice ramp-up in difficulty for this
                problem, from open-loop “divide the world into a grid”
                approaches, to 3d bin-packing optimization, to reinforcement
                learning. An interesting aspect of this problem for us is that
                the bags should be physically stable when the cart starts
                driving, and lighter, deformable objects shouldn’t be underneath
                heavy, hard objects. We use a similar mix of physics and
                learning to model this problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Fast collision-free planning: Off the shelf planners work
                great for the most part but can fail in heavily cluttered areas
                or dynamic scenes. We leverage the fact that we’re always
                solving a series of similar problems to provide initial guesses
                for downstream trajectory optimization algorithms. Since each
                problem is so similar, we can use techniques similar to
                generative models to propose these initial plans.
              </p>

                - Mechanical design: The perfect tool to pick up everything
                checked down a conveyor belt isn’t an easy thing to design.
                We’re building tools with multiple modes of grasping to handle
                wide varieties of objects. The videos we linked to are all with
                suction only – which can be surprisingly powerful! An
                interesting aspect of autonomy becomes choosing which mode to
                use when, and how to use it.
              </p>
              <p>
                These problems can be deeply interlinked: where you grasp an
                object depends on what your tooling looks like and informs where
                you can put it– so a perfect solution would jointly reason about
                both problems simultaneously. We’re looking forward to getting
                there as we collect more data and continue our efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Check out our demo videos above! We have a brand new hardware
                stack coming soon (and we’ve added a new end effector that we’re
                keeping hush), but it’s amazing what you can do with pure
                suction.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re proud of our progress so far but would love to hear your
                thoughts and feedback. Let us know if you’ve had a particularly
                bad baggage horror story and/or have personal experience with
                the industry.

                Since then, everyone from the model providers to LLM ops
                companies built a prompt playground. We had one too, until we
                realized this was totally the wrong approach:
              </p>
              <p>- It's not connected to your application code</p>
              <p>- They don't support all models</p>
              <p>
                - You have to rebuild evals for just this one prompt (can't use
                your end-to-end evals)
              </p>
              <p>
                In other words, it was a ton of work and time to use these to
                actually make your app better. So, we built a new experience and
                are relaunching around this idea:
              </p>
              <p>
                Gentrace is a collaborative LLM app testing and experimentation
                platform that brings together engineers, PMs, subject matter
                experts, and more to run and test your actual end-to-end app.
              </p>
              <p>To do this, use our SDK to:</p>
              <p>
                - connect your app to Gentrace as a live runner over websocket
                (local) / via webhook (staging, prod)
              </p>
              <p>
                - wrap your parameters (eg prompt, model, top-k) so they become
                tunable knobs in the front end
              </p>
              <p>
                - edit the parameters and then run / evaluate the actual app
                code with datasets and evals in Gentrace
              </p>
              <p>
                We think it's great for tuning retrieval systems, upgrading
                models, and iterating on prompts.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's free to trial. Would love to hear your feedback / what you
                think!
