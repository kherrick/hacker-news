              <p>
                I posted here some years ago trying to raise money for a
                Kickstarter for a product I call Loodio.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loodio is a motion activated music player for bathrooms that
                plays music during the bathroom visit to give users privacy
                during their sacred moments.
              </p>
              <p>
                The kickstarter failed, but I managed to create a product
                eventually with a lot of effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                I managed to sell 150 units of the first unit, mostly to United
                States but to all different parts of the world while working on
                the next version.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem with the first version was that it was running on a
                Raspberry Pi Zero W (that had to be wall connected) and it was
                pretty big, had crappy sound and took a minute to start since it
                had to boot a whole linux system. I was running it on a python
                script and unix services. To add music, people had to SSH into
                the unit so you can imagine how painful that was for some.
              </p>
              <p>
                However customers loved it! But I knew I could do better. The
                most common request was battery operation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some reviews of version 1:

                  >https://loodio.com/pages/reviews</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm proud to say that Loodio 2 is finally here and is working
                like I imagined when I started working on it almost 5 years ago
                now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loodio 2 introduces battery operation with 1 week of battery
                life (~5 hours of active operation). It has great sound and an
                easy way to add your own music with SD card support (4GB
                included).
              </p>
              <p>
                It doesn't require any app. Can be run without WiFi (however you
                lose some features like internet radio, time updates, software
                updates and weather)
              </p>
              <p>
                Why does it have a display, you may ask? Because, I used to have
                an electric toothbrush that came with a display. That display
                showed how long you were brushing to make sure you did your 2
                minutes per brush. When I wasn't brushing my teeth, it showed
                the current time. And I stopped using the electric tooth brush
                (because a dentist told me they are too harsh on your teeth) but
                kept the display for probably 5 years afterwards because I
                noticed I really want to know the time while getting ready for
                school/work in the morning. Another thing I noticed was that I
                always check the weather outside, so I could dress
                appropriately.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, Loodio shows you the time and weather (optionally) as well
                as playing music during your visit. These features together with
                the lights, are features that I think people don't expect to use
                but with time becomes as important as the music. Customer
                interviews verify this.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wasted a lot of money trying to outsource the development the
                first 18 months. I then decided to start doing it myself. The
                version I'm selling is actually the 25th(!) iteration of the
                product. The problem with hardware is that it takes you around a
                month to iterate a circuit (if you don't live next to the
                factory in Shenzhen) because of the cycle 'Designing-&gt;Order
                from China-&gt;Testing-&gt;Repeat'. And I had no experience of
                electronics when starting out.
              </p>
              <p>
                The enclosure is made from empty PCBs to save money for
                injection tooling later. It looks pretty cool. But mainly, works
                great!
              </p>
              <p>
                I want to give credit to Tadeusz Karpinski and Velimir Stoleski
                that ported my crappy python script to the ESP32 that is running
                Loodio 2.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need to try it! I really think you're gonna like it!

              <p>
                Voiden is a free, offline, Git-native API client. Your API
                definitions, docs, and tests all live together.
              </p>
              <p>
                It came out of years of frustration: cloud sync lock-in,
                paywalled basics, bloated UIs, and lag on even simple requests.
                So the team built the opposite: an offline tool with no login,
                no telemetry, no lock-in. Just markdown and hotkeys.
              </p>
              <p>
                It behaves like code: local files, git branches, no cloud
                nonsense. Terminal is built-in, so you can commit, diff, and
                push changes right from the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Docs stay close to your requests, so that API spec and what the
                API actually does never drift apart. No more scattered Postman,
                docs, and test files everywhere. A single source of truth.
              </p>
              <p>A minimalist GET request looks something like this:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>      GET
      https://dummyjson.com/posts
</code></pre>
              Just hit /endpoint, paste the URL, and run it with Cmd/Ctrl +
              Enter.
              <p>
                Not OSS (yet), but 100% local and free. Optional plugins will be
                coming down the line, but the core stays free.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'd love feedback from folks tired of overcomplicated and
                bloated API tooling.

                The core idea: instead of giving every query the same "thinking
                time," classify queries as HIGH or LOW complexity and allocate
                thinking tokens accordingly. Complex reasoning gets 70-90% of
                tokens, simple queries get 20-40%.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also implemented steering vectors derived from Pivotal Token
                Search (originally from Microsoft's Phi-4 paper) that guide the
                model's reasoning patterns during generation. These vectors
                encourage behaviors like numerical accuracy, self-correction,
                and thorough exploration.
              </p>
              <p>Results on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B:</p>
              <p>
                - GPQA-Diamond: 31.06% vs 21.72% baseline (+43% relative
                improvement)
              </p>
              <p>- MMLU-Pro: 26.38% vs 25.58% baseline</p>
              <p>- Uses fewer tokens than baseline approaches</p>
              <p>
                Works with any local reasoning model - DeepSeek, Qwen, custom
                fine-tuned models. No API dependencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The technique builds on two things I developed: an adaptive
                classification framework that can learn new complexity
                categories without retraining, and an open source implementation
                of Pivotal Token Search.

                I'm curious about your thoughts on adaptive resource allocation
                for AI reasoning. Have you tried similar approaches with your
                local models?
