                We’re an AI language learning app where you talk to your AI
                Tutor, just like you would with a human one. Here’s a short demo
                of what that looks like in an actual conversation:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IukKGc00juY"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IukKGc00juY</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We actually started as a Show HN over a year ago and the
                responses we got from the HN community led us to apply to YC and
                make an actual company out of a side project (original Show HN
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32993130"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32993130</a
                >). We were called Quazel which we have since realized is too
                hard to spell and only makes sense in German.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started off as only offering open-ended conversations. While
                that is still at the core of what we do, we quickly realized
                that we need to solve a bigger problem for learners than simply
                giving them the option to hold a conversation with an AI.
                Tutoring is (usually) the highest quality of education you can
                get. The curriculum is based on your interests and needs, you
                move at your own pace and you get personalized feedback about
                your specific mistakes.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, the reality is that tutoring is prohibitively
                expensive for most people, let alone that it can be very
                time-consuming to find a tutor that you like and you have to
                work around their schedule. We want to fix these issues by
                providing an AI Language Tutor that’s available whenever you
                want and affordable to everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now the tricky thing about this, is that a human tutor (to no
                one’s surprise) actually does many things at the same time,
                which are very much not straightforward to approximate, even
                with AI. The interaction part of a tutor session is already the
                main interaction in Univerbal, through speaking and having the
                replies read out loud. The hard part intervenes when you try to
                replicate the progress tracking and tailoring of the curriculum.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are things that tutors automatically do, and getting a
                system, even one that’s based on LLM to do something like that
                is very hard! Our current approach is based on “Skills” (e.g. I
                can introduce myself), that a user works towards. These are a
                measure of where the user currently stands and we use this
                progress in a feedback loop to come up with relevant and
                interesting next lessons for a learner.
              </p>
              <p>
                I often get asked, “Ohh so is it like Duolingo?”. When I get
                that question, I smile, feel something inside me die and then
                say that, while Duolingo is a great language-learning app, we
                don’t really see them as our competition, rather we see online
                tutoring platforms (italki, verbling, cambly etc.) as the
                companies we’re “attacking”.
              </p>
              <p>
                We already have a couple of success stories. One of which comes
                from an Australian user who’s living in Italy and has
                successfully prepared herself for her Italian B2 language exam
                by using Univerbal :). If you’d like to give it a try, you can
                try it without an account for free for 7 days (no credit card
                required). Afterwards, it’s about $10ish/month.
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing I’d love to get HN’s opinion on is how much
                gamification you think we should add. On the one hand, we don’t
                want to become a “game” and a Tutor lesson is always a “hard”
                thing and kind of exhausting, but there is obviously some
                balance to be struck there. Thoughts?

                Hey y’all. My brother and I have made a framework for board
                games. During the pandemic we started to look at BGA but got
                discouraged by how old-fashioned the tools were and how
                cumbersome the development process was. We set out to make our
                own framework where you could use the same code for both the
                client and server. Our hope is anyone familiar with Typescript
                and CSS could code up a game without worrying about state
                management, persistence or networking.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s still very much a wip, and we're rapidly adding features
                and games. But we’ve got our first draft of developer docs done,
                and we've put up a few games we've developed to showcase and
                test out the platform. Source for the games and framework is
                available on Github, and we’re excited to code more games and
                hopefully encourage other people to try it out. Happy for any
                feedback.

                <i>Cost anomalies are slow to detect and hard to diagnose.</i>
                For example, a computer vision company noticed their AWS costs
                spiking one month. Costs accrued until they identified the
                culprit: one of their customers had put up a life-size cutout of
                John Wayne, and they were running non-stop facial recognition on
                it.
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) <i>No cost accountability in big orgs.</i> For example, a
                public tech company’s top priority last year was to increase
                gross margin. But they had no way to identify the highest cost
                managers/products or measure improvement despite tagging
                efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                (3)
                <i>Uncertain and variable per-customer gross margins.</i> For
                example, a SaaS startup had one customer generating &gt;50% of
                its revenue. That customer’s usage of certain features had
                recently 1,000x’ed, and they weren’t sure the contract was still
                profitable.
              </p>
              <p>
                (If you’ve had an experience like this, we’d love to hear about
                it in the comments.)
              </p>
              <p>
                We built Dashdive because none of the existing cloud cost
                dashboard products solves all three of these problems, which
                often requires <i>sub-resource</i> cost attribution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Existing tools combine AWS, GCP, Datadog, Snowflake, etc. cost
                data in a single dashboard with additional features like
                alerting and cost cutting recommendations. This is sufficient in
                many cases, but it falls short when a company (a) wants
                per-customer, per-team or per-feature cost visibility and (b)
                has a multitenant architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                By contrast, Dashdive uses observability tools to collect
                granular cloud usage data at the level of individual user
                actions (e.g. each API call or database transaction). We
                attribute this activity to the corresponding feature, the
                responsible customer and team and estimate its cost based on the
                applicable rate. The result is more detailed cost and usage data
                than can be obtained with tagging. This information can be used
                to detect anomalies in real-time and identify costly teams,
                features and customers. One of our customers is even using
                Dashdive to charge customers for their cloud usage.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use Kafka to ingest large volumes (&gt;100m/day) of product
                usage events, and our web dashboard supports real-time querying
                thanks to ClickHouse. This makes it fast and easy to answer
                questions like: “Over the past 14 days, how much vCPU time did
                customer X use on Kubernetes cluster A, and how much did that
                cost me?” You can answer such questions even when the same
                container or pod is shared by multiple customers, features
                and/or teams.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can test drive the product with example data here:
                <a href="https://demo.dashdive.com/"
                  >https://demo.dashdive.com/</a
                >. Given the high per-customer cost of our infrastructure and
                the manual steps required for setup on our part, we don’t offer
                self-serve onboarding or a public “free tier” to monitor your
                own cloud usage, but this demo gives a basic view of our
                product.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, Dashdive supports S3 and S3-compatible object storage
                providers. We’re working to add support for other providers and
                services, particularly compute services (EC2, GCP VMs, ECS, EKS,
                GKE, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                If there’s any service in particular you want to see supported,
                please tell us in the comments. We’re eager to see your
                comments, questions, concerns, etc.

              <p>---</p>
              <p>
                When trying to schedule events with my friends, we often have a
                long text thread of sporadic dates and the group has to mentally
                combine all the messages to produce a date that works for all.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are plenty of apps out there to coordinate scheduling, but
                I found many of them were bloated with features that didn't
                matter to us, required user sign ups and app downloads. This
                friction is enough for us to prefer rudimentary long text
                threads. I wanted something that I could post in the thread
                once, my friends can add their availability on their own time
                (and can edit), and we can continue on our conversation.
              </p>
              <p>
                WAYF (When are you free?) is a fun side project that solves this
                issue. Bare-bones scheduling for what days you are free. No user
                accounts, no downloads, just paste a link and anyone can
                schedule. It's completely free.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope you like it and find it useful, I would love feedback.
