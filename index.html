              <a href="https://withaqua.com/">https://withaqua.com/</a>). Aqua
              is a voice-native document editor that combines reliable dictation
              and natural language commands, letting you say things like: “make
              this a list” or “it’s Erin with an E” or “add an inline citation
              here for page 86 of this book”. Here is a demo:
              <a href="https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM"
                >https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM</a
              >.
              <p>
                Finn, who is big-time dyslexic, has been using dictation
                software since the sixth grade when his dad set him up on Dragon
                Dictation. He used it through school to write papers, and has
                been keeping his own transcription benchmarks since college. All
                that time, writing with your voice has remained a cumbersome and
                brittle experience that is riddled with painpoints.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dictation software is still terrible. All the solutions
                basically compete on accuracy (i.e. speech recognition), but
                none of them deal with the fundamentally brittle nature of the
                text that they generate. They don't try to format text correctly
                and require you to learn a bunch of specialized commands, which
                often are not worth it. They're not even close to a voice
                replacement for a keyboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even post LLM, you are limited to a set of specific commands and
                the most accurate models don’t have any commands. Outside of
                these rules, the models have no sense for what is an instruction
                and what is content. You can’t say “and format this like an
                email” or “make the last bullet point shorter”. Aqua solves
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                This problem is important to Finn and millions of other people
                who would write with their voice if they could. Initially, we
                didn't think of it as a startup project. It was just something
                we wanted for ourselves. We thought maybe we'd write a novel
                with it - or something. After friends started asking to use the
                early versions of Aqua, it occurred to us that, if we didn't
                build it, maybe nobody would.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aqua Voice is a text editor that you talk to like a person.
                Depending on the way that you say it and the context in which
                you're operating, Aqua decides whether to transcribe what you
                said verbatim, execute a command, or subtly modify what you said
                into what you meant to write.
              </p>

                For example, if you were to dictate: "Gryphons have classic
                forms resembling shield volcanoes," Aqua would output your text
                verbatim. But if you stumble over your words or start a sentence
                over a few times, Aqua is smart enough to figure that out and to
                only take the last version of the sentence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vision is not only to provide a more natural dictation
                experience, but to enable for the first time an AI-writing
                experience that feels natural and collaborative. This requires
                moving away from using LLMs for one-off chat requests and
                towards something that is more like streaming where you are in
                constant contact with the model. Voice is the natural medium for
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aqua is actually 6 models working together to transcribe,
                interpret, and rewrite the document according to your intent.
                Technically, executing a real-time voice application with a
                language model at its core requires complex coordination between
                multiple pieces. We use MoE transcription to outperform what was
                previously thought possible in terms of real-time accuracy. Then
                we sync up with a language model to determine what should be on
                the screen as quickly as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The model isn't perfect, but it is ready for early adopters and
                we’ve already been getting feedback from grateful users. For
                example, a historian with carpal tunnel sent us an email he
                wrote using Aqua and said that he is now able to be five times
                as productive as he was previously. We've heard from other
                people with disabilities that prevent them from typing. We've
                also seen good adoption from people who are dyslexic or simply
                prefer talking to typing. It’s being used for everything from
                emails to brainstorming to papers to legal briefings.
              </p>
              <p>
                While there is much left to do in terms of latency and
                robustness, the best experiences with Aqua are beginning to feel
                magical. We would love for you to try it out and give us
                feedback, which you can do with no account on
                <a href="https://withaqua.com">https://withaqua.com</a>. If you
                find it useful, it’s $10/month after a 1000-token free trial.
                (We want to bump the free trial in the future, but we're a small
                team, and running this thing isn’t cheap.)
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love to hear your ideas and comments with voice-to-text!

              <a href="https://commodityai.io">https://commodityai.io</a>). We
              make commodity shipments easy to manage.
              <p>
                Commodities are the center of global trade. The food you eat and
                the coffee you drink all start with agricultural producers. A
                trader organizes a shipment of it to a receiver near you, who
                then manufactures and distributes it to your local supermarket
                or coffee shop.
              </p>
              <p>
                That sounds simple enough, but any shipment involving
                commodities involves around 200 processes, at least 50
                documents, and extensive coordination through emails and phone
                calls. The amount of paper and processes is staggering. Errors
                can be catastrophically costly, ending up with lawsuits over
                millions of dollars.
              </p>
              <p>
                Commodity trading companies allocate 40% of their workforce to
                logistics and operations. It’s a relationship-focused business.
                These aren't trading firms with Bloomberg terminals doing spot
                trading with algorithms all day. They are trading actual
                physical commodities. Many of these deals are agreed on via text
                message.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now imagine you're managing thousands of shipments a month.
                Nearly every trader we’ve talked to can recall a time in the
                past 6 months where a document or process error resulted in the
                firm losing hundreds of thousands of dollars.
              </p>
              <p>
                This led us to explore how we could tailor AI, automation, and
                collaboration tools to automate the handling of shipment
                workflows for more efficient operations and accurate
                documentation. Our team has the background to solve this
                problem—an ex-sugar trader with 8 years of experience and two
                engineers with a combined 14 years of experience from logistics
                and software companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a few layers to solving the pain points of these
                customers:
              </p>
              <p>
                (1) Data Preprocessing: we give them a way to clean up and
                organize their existing data, which is usually a mess. We help
                them process documents, classify them, extract relevant fields,
                organize them by shipments, and search for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) We use AI and automation to leverage OCR, Multi-Modal
                Transformers, and indexing methods across 150+ different
                commodity and logistics document types to automate business
                processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                (3) Actions and Workflows: Once the data is processed, we enable
                users to take actions or kickoff workflows with them, such as
                entering data into ERPs, using AI agents to compose emails,
                update freight matrices, track their shipments and predict
                delays, and more. All of these things are things the user does
                manually currently and are prone to error, so we automate them
                to save time and money. An ops team currently spends 60% of
                their day on these tasks. With our initial product, we are
                already saving them 2 hours a day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our customers so far include one of the largest U.S.
                agricultural traders, who use our platform to process over a
                million documents and automate internal workflows, like creating
                vessel nominations and updating shipment statuses. They also use
                us to find critical documents quickly. Importers and exporters
                randomly get audited to make sure the commodity they declared
                matches what was actually delivered (quality, weight,
                polarization). These audits can happen years after the shipment,
                and searching for the relevant documents is a needle/haystack
                situation. Sometimes they have been unable to find them, and you
                can imagine how well that goes over with the auditors. We make
                this easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can’t give HN readers direct access to the product because it
                can only be used if you have commodity data and that data is
                sensitive. But here’s a video showing how it works:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slOGliSR6IM#t=26s"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slOGliSR6IM#t=26s</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                There probably aren’t too many commodity traders checking HN
                every day, but we figure some of you have worked as traders or
                know traders from previous work experience, and we’d love to
                hear whatever you think about this!

                I noticed that I often looked for new books, depending on my
