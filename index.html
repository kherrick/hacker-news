              <p>
                I’d love to introduce Figr Identity, which helps you generate
                design systems with variables, styles, Styles sheets and custom
                components in your design language. We built this plugin to take
                away the non-creative work from the design system setup process.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Setup the design tokens: Colours, typography, corner radius,
                spacing system, grids and elevation.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Setup the component Library: All the design tokens are
                automatically reflected in custom component library.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Export to Figma: Get the style guideline, variables, and
                component library to your file in a single click.
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love to hear your feedback as we continue to improve the
                plugin :)

                because I wanted to use Jinja templating inside Markdown.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once I was done, I decided to strip out `staticjinja` in favour
                of my own site generator.
              </p>
              <p>And so Jinjabread was born!</p>

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                When I was studying at MIT, I often had to wait 40-60 minutes in
                line just to get 5 minutes of “help” from a TA - when I needed
                1-2 hours. I understood that TAs can’t spend all their time
                helping me. That’s understandable. But what made me bitter was
                that, the school went the extra mile to ensure I don’t have the
                resources to learn on my own,
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Blocking access to solutions for past problems (to prevent
                cheating)
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Purposely not recording explanations to increase attendance:
                https://piazza.com/class/ky0jj3k89mz5d2/post/9
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Insisting that Office Hours is a 1-by-1 format even when
                crowded (to prevent solutions from leaking)
              </p>
              <p>
                These policies have good intentions - it’s to encourage a
                synchronous, in-person learning experience. But in practice, it
                had side-effects:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Help resources become inefficient - because so much material
                is restricted, and so much time is spent on delivering live
                lectures, there’d often be 40 students competing for help from 2
                TAs in a 2-hour Office Hours
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Because help resources are inefficient, it’s very hard to
                catch-up: once you fall behind, you have no way to review past
                material efficiently enough to compensate the difference - like
                credit card debt
              </p>
              <p>
                3.Every day, I’d wake up, go to a lecture I don’t understand, go
                to Office Hours so I can hopefully ask for a review (which’d
                would take a few hours), realize TAs aren’t willing to do that,
                then realize there is nothing I can do to recover. I fell into a
                depression for many years, and my bitterness fueled me to work
                on the early versions of explanations.app
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out that universities succeed by being prestigious, not
                by teaching well. To win at prestige, be highly selective (by
                keeping supply low), keep a huge endowment (because it affects
                school rankings), and hire the best researchers (not teachers).
                This is actually the fundamental reason for the odd incentives
                in higher education, and something felt wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
                So explanations.app is completely inspired by KhanAcademy and
                Youtube. The mystery to me was - why weren’t there more Youtube
                teachers &amp; KhanAcademy videos? I believe it’s a combination
                of:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. People who teach college subjects well often have better
                opportunities e.g. work, research
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Lack of rewards: even Youtubers with 100K views and 10K
                subscribers would have at most 1-5 paying members on Patreon
              </p>
              <p>
                On the one hand, there are all these free resources, where
                teachers changed the world way more than they ever got rewarded
                for. Then on the other hand, there is private tutoring - very
                effective - but very expensive e.g. $100/hour for college level
                subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe the balanced solution is a system where lots of
                students pay $10/week to a few teachers who make videos, like a
                paid, Q&amp;A Youtube/KhanAcademy, so it’s personalized,
                effective, but still affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are currently 2 teachers on explanations.app - Ben &amp;
                Esther - both MIT grads, teaching physics &amp; math for
                subjects like linear algebra and electromagnetism. 3 students -
                Laquazia, Lidija and Chandra from US, Serbia and Korea joined
                this month following r/physicsStudents launch:
                [https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1b2t5u6/i_started_a_program_where_mit_grads_do_physics/]
              </p>
              <p>
                While explanations.app is focused on college-level math and
                physics, the platform is completely open for anyone to learn
                and/or teach. I hope you can try it :^) and give me the chance
                to work with you.

              <p>
                We had a successful launch on HN a year ago, and have moved
                quickly since and are now starting to close large companies
                deploying our software to touch millions of users.
              </p>
              <p>
                We continue to have an ambitious roadmap and are looking for a
                founding senior engineer to radically improve the product (take
                it from a 1-&gt;10, we have already built the 0-&gt;1) and help
                "level-up" the founders. We need our product to scale to tens of
                millions of messages sent an hour, handle millions of incoming
                api requests, add introduce engineering best practices, and
                tooling for our product to maintain SLAs
              </p>
              <p>
                The right engineer will be excited to join a small team, excited
                to work on open source software, works well autonomously, can
                deal with ambiguity, and wants to work remotely (with minimum 4
                hours of overlap sometime between 8am - 8pm pst)
              </p>
              <p>Some more details:</p>
              <p>
                - We work in Typescript with Nest.js for the backend and react
                for the frontend - We use technologies like: clickhouse,
                postgres, bullmq, docker, mongo, kafka, - We are a remote team
                out of NY/Mountain View wants to work remotely (with minimum 4
                hours of overlap sometime between 8am - 8pm pst) - Did we
                mention we are open source :D (<a
                  href="https://github.com/laudspeaker/laudspeaker"
                  >https://github.com/laudspeaker/laudspeaker</a
                >) - We raised our seed round from top tier investors (including
                YC) - We are closing large enterprises in regulated industries
                with millions of users
              </p>
              <p>
                The founding engineer will be fullstack, but will focus more on
                backend and do things like:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Improve the performance of our application to handle
                significant load - Improve the reliability of our product,
                including implementing best practices and tooling - Quickly
                build new user friendly features - Build and improve our mobile
                sdks and their associated endpoints - In general scaling our
                0-&gt;1 product from 1-&gt;10
              </p>
              <p>
                Who You Are: - You are a very strong senior engineer (5+ years
                of industry experience) who can work autonomously and can deal
                with ambiguity - You are comfortable working at all levels of
                the stack - from creating new endpoints, and components to
                deploying our app - You have great knowledge of working with
                AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes - You have great proficiency in
                TypeScript and NodeJs
              </p>
              <p>
                Bonus: - Have worked in the product analytics or customer
                engagement spaces before - Have taken a SaaS product from 10 to
                1000 customers - Has hacked on mobile sdks before - Has worked
                remotely before
              </p>
              <p>About the interview:</p>
              <p>
                Between one and two rounds of phone screens followed by a one
                month (paid) contracting period. You'll be paid full salary and
                will be doing the same job as what you would when working with
                us full time.
              </p>
              <p>
                We find contracting is a much better way of evaluating fit than
                a coding screen and gives both us and you a chance to make sure
                we work well together. Contracting can be terminated early if
                either party feels its not going well.
              </p>

              <a href="https://withaqua.com/">https://withaqua.com/</a>). Aqua
              is a voice-native document editor that combines reliable dictation
              and natural language commands, letting you say things like: “make
              this a list” or “it’s Erin with an E” or “add an inline citation
              here for page 86 of this book”. Here is a demo:
              <a href="https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM"
                >https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM</a
              >.
              <p>
                Finn, who is big-time dyslexic, has been using dictation
                software since the sixth grade when his dad set him up on Dragon
                Dictation. He used it through school to write papers, and has
                been keeping his own transcription benchmarks since college. All
                that time, writing with your voice has remained a cumbersome and
                brittle experience that is riddled with painpoints.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dictation software is still terrible. All the solutions
                basically compete on accuracy (i.e. speech recognition), but
                none of them deal with the fundamentally brittle nature of the
                text that they generate. They don't try to format text correctly
                and require you to learn a bunch of specialized commands, which
                often are not worth it. They're not even close to a voice
                replacement for a keyboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even post LLM, you are limited to a set of specific commands and
                the most accurate models don’t have any commands. Outside of
                these rules, the models have no sense for what is an instruction
                and what is content. You can’t say “and format this like an
                email” or “make the last bullet point shorter”. Aqua solves
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                This problem is important to Finn and millions of other people
                who would write with their voice if they could. Initially, we
                didn't think of it as a startup project. It was just something
                we wanted for ourselves. We thought maybe we'd write a novel
                with it - or something. After friends started asking to use the
                early versions of Aqua, it occurred to us that, if we didn't
                build it, maybe nobody would.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aqua Voice is a text editor that you talk to like a person.
                Depending on the way that you say it and the context in which
                you're operating, Aqua decides whether to transcribe what you
                said verbatim, execute a command, or subtly modify what you said
                into what you meant to write.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if you were to dictate: "Gryphons have classic
                forms resembling shield volcanoes," Aqua would output your text
                verbatim. But if you stumble over your words or start a sentence
                over a few times, Aqua is smart enough to figure that out and to
                only take the last version of the sentence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vision is not only to provide a more natural dictation
                experience, but to enable for the first time an AI-writing
                experience that feels natural and collaborative. This requires
                moving away from using LLMs for one-off chat requests and
                towards something that is more like streaming where you are in
                constant contact with the model. Voice is the natural medium for
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aqua is actually 6 models working together to transcribe,
                interpret, and rewrite the document according to your intent.
                Technically, executing a real-time voice application with a
                language model at its core requires complex coordination between
                multiple pieces. We use MoE transcription to outperform what was
                previously thought possible in terms of real-time accuracy. Then
                we sync up with a language model to determine what should be on
                the screen as quickly as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The model isn't perfect, but it is ready for early adopters and
                we’ve already been getting feedback from grateful users. For
                example, a historian with carpal tunnel sent us an email he
                wrote using Aqua and said that he is now able to be five times
                as productive as he was previously. We've heard from other
                people with disabilities that prevent them from typing. We've
                also seen good adoption from people who are dyslexic or simply
                prefer talking to typing. It’s being used for everything from
                emails to brainstorming to papers to legal briefings.
              </p>
              <p>
                While there is much left to do in terms of latency and
                robustness, the best experiences with Aqua are beginning to feel
                magical. We would love for you to try it out and give us
                feedback, which you can do with no account on
                <a href="https://withaqua.com">https://withaqua.com</a>. If you
                find it useful, it’s $10/month after a 1000-token free trial.
                (We want to bump the free trial in the future, but we're a small
                team, and running this thing isn’t cheap.)
              </p>

              <a href="https://commodityai.io">https://commodityai.io</a>). We
              make commodity shipments easy to manage.
              <p>
                Commodities are the center of global trade. The food you eat and
                the coffee you drink all start with agricultural producers. A
                trader organizes a shipment of it to a receiver near you, who
                then manufactures and distributes it to your local supermarket
                or coffee shop.
              </p>
              <p>
                That sounds simple enough, but any shipment involving
                commodities involves around 200 processes, at least 50
                documents, and extensive coordination through emails and phone
                calls. The amount of paper and processes is staggering. Errors
                can be catastrophically costly, ending up with lawsuits over
                millions of dollars.
              </p>
              <p>
                Commodity trading companies allocate 40% of their workforce to
                logistics and operations. It’s a relationship-focused business.
                These aren't trading firms with Bloomberg terminals doing spot
                trading with algorithms all day. They are trading actual
                physical commodities. Many of these deals are agreed on via text
                message.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now imagine you're managing thousands of shipments a month.
                Nearly every trader we’ve talked to can recall a time in the
                past 6 months where a document or process error resulted in the
                firm losing hundreds of thousands of dollars.
              </p>
              <p>
                This led us to explore how we could tailor AI, automation, and
                collaboration tools to automate the handling of shipment
                workflows for more efficient operations and accurate
                documentation. Our team has the background to solve this
                problem—an ex-sugar trader with 8 years of experience and two
                engineers with a combined 14 years of experience from logistics
                and software companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a few layers to solving the pain points of these
                customers:
              </p>
              <p>
                (1) Data Preprocessing: we give them a way to clean up and
                organize their existing data, which is usually a mess. We help
                them process documents, classify them, extract relevant fields,
                organize them by shipments, and search for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) We use AI and automation to leverage OCR, Multi-Modal
                Transformers, and indexing methods across 150+ different
                commodity and logistics document types to automate business
                processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                (3) Actions and Workflows: Once the data is processed, we enable
                users to take actions or kickoff workflows with them, such as
                entering data into ERPs, using AI agents to compose emails,
                update freight matrices, track their shipments and predict
                delays, and more. All of these things are things the user does
                manually currently and are prone to error, so we automate them
                to save time and money. An ops team currently spends 60% of
                their day on these tasks. With our initial product, we are
                already saving them 2 hours a day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our customers so far include one of the largest U.S.
                agricultural traders, who use our platform to process over a
                million documents and automate internal workflows, like creating
                vessel nominations and updating shipment statuses. They also use
                us to find critical documents quickly. Importers and exporters
                randomly get audited to make sure the commodity they declared
                matches what was actually delivered (quality, weight,
                polarization). These audits can happen years after the shipment,
                and searching for the relevant documents is a needle/haystack
                situation. Sometimes they have been unable to find them, and you
                can imagine how well that goes over with the auditors. We make
                this easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can’t give HN readers direct access to the product because it
                can only be used if you have commodity data and that data is
                sensitive. But here’s a video showing how it works:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slOGliSR6IM#t=26s"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slOGliSR6IM#t=26s</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                There probably aren’t too many commodity traders checking HN
                every day, but we figure some of you have worked as traders or
                know traders from previous work experience, and we’d love to
                hear whatever you think about this!

                manage project finances using Kanban boards.

                confidence, ensuring your resources are allocated efficiently
                and effectively.
