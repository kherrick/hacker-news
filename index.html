                markdown file in `.continue/checks/` that shows up as a GitHub
                status check. They run as full agents, not just reading the
                diff, but able to read/write files, run bash commands, and use a
                browser. If it finds something, the check fails with one click
                to accept a diff. Otherwise, it passes silently.
              </p>
              <p>Here’s one of ours:</p>

  name: Metrics Integrity
  description: Detects changes that could inflate, deflate, or corrupt metrics (session counts, event accuracy, etc.)
  ---

  Review this PR for changes that could unintentionally distort metrics.
  These bugs are insidious because they corrupt dashboards without triggering errors or test failures.

  Check for:
  - "Find or create" patterns where the "find" is too narrow, causing entity duplication (e.g. querying only active sessions, missing completed ones, so every new commit creates a duplicate)
  - Event tracking calls inside loops or retry paths that fire multiple times per logical action
  - Refactors that accidentally remove or move tracking calls to a path that executes with different frequency

  Key files: anything containing `posthog.capture` or `trackEvent`

</code></pre>
              This check passed without noise for weeks, but then caught a PR
              that would have silently deflated our session counts. We added it
              in the first place because we’d been burned in the past by bad
              data, only noticing when a dashboard looked off.
              <p>---</p>
              <p>
                To get started, paste this into Claude Code or your coding agent

              <a href="https://sonarly.com">https://sonarly.com</a>), an AI
              engineer for production. It connects to your observability tools
              like Sentry, Datadog, or user feedback channels, triages issues,
              and fixes them to cut your resolution time. Here's a demo:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr3VHv0eRdw"

                Sonarly is really about removing the noise from production
                alerts by grouping duplicates and returning a root cause
                analysis to save time to on-call engineers and literally cut
                your MTTR.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before starting this company, my co-founder and I had a B2C app
                in edtech and had, some days, thousands of users using the app.
                We pushed several times a day, relying on user feedback. Then we
                set up Sentry, it was catching a lot of bugs, but we had up to
                50 alerts a day. With 2 people it's a lot. We took a lot of time
                filtering the noise to find the real signal so we knew which bug
                to focus on.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, we saw how important it is to fix a bug fast
                when it hits users. A bug means in the worst case a churn and at
                best a frustrated user. And there are always bugs in production,
                due to code errors, database mismatches, infrastructure
                overload, and many issues are linked to a specific user
                behavior. You can't catch all these beforehand, even with E2E
                tests or AI code reviews (which catch a lot of bugs but
                obviously not all, plus it takes time to run at each
                deployment). This is even more true with vibe-coding (or agentic
                engineering).
              </p>
              <p>
                We started Sonarly with this idea. More software than ever is
                being built and users should have the best experience possible
                on every product. The main idea of Sonarly is to reduce the MTTR
                (Mean Time To Repair).
              </p>
              <p>
                We started by recreating a Sentry-like tool but without the
                noise, using only text and session replays as the interface. We
                built our own frontend tracker (based on open-source rrweb) and
                used the backend Sentry SDK (open source as well). Companies
                could just add another tracker in the frontend and add a DSN in
                their Sentry config to send data to us in addition to Sentry.
              </p>
              <p>
                We wanted to build an interface where you don't need to check
                logs, dashboards, traces, metrics, and code, as the agent would
                do it for you with plain English to explain the "what," "why,"
                and "how do I fix it."
              </p>
              <p>
                We quickly realized companies don't want to add a new tracker or
                change their monitoring stack, as these platforms do the job
                they're supposed to do. So we decided to build above them. Now
                we connect to tools like Sentry, Datadog, Slack user feedback
                channels, and other integrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claude Code is so good at writing code, but handling runtime
                issues requires more than just raw coding ability. It demands
                deep runtime context, immediate reactivity, and intelligent
                triage, you can’t simply pipe every alert directly into an
                agent. That’s why our first step is converting noise into
                signal. We group duplicates and filter false positives to
                isolate clear issues. Once we have a confirmed signal, we
                trigger Claude Code with the exact context it needs, like the
                specific Sentry issue and relevant logs fetched via MCP (mostly
                using grep on Datadog/Grafana). However, things get
                exponentially harder with multi-repo and multi-service
                architectures.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we built an internal map of the production system that is
                basically a .md file updated dynamically. It shows every link
                between different services, logs, and metrics so that Claude
                Code can understand the issue faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of our users using Sentry was receiving ~180 alerts/day.
                Here is what their workflow looked like:
              </p>
              <p>- Receive the alert</p>
              <p>
                - 1) Defocus from their current task or wake up, or 2) don't
                look at the alert at all (most of the time)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Go check dashboards to find the root cause (if infra type) or
                read the stack trace, events, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Try to figure out if it was a false positive or a real problem
                (or a known problem already in the fixes pipeline)
              </p>
              <p>- Then fix by giving Claude Code the correct context</p>
              <p>
                We started by cutting the noise and went from 180/day to 50/day
                (by grouping issues) and giving a severity based on the impact
                on the user/infra. This brings it down to 5 issues to focus on
                in the current day. Triage happens in 3 steps: deduplicating
                before triggering a coding agent, gathering the root cause for
                each alert, and re-grouping by RCA.

                  >https://sonarly.com</a
                >) and we would love to have feedback from engineers. Especially
                curious about your current workflows when you receive an alert
                from any of these channels like Sentry (error tracking), Datadog
                (APM), or user feedback. How do you assign who should fix it?
                Where do you take your context from to fix the issue? Do you
                have any automated workflow to fix every bug, and do you have
                anything you use currently to filter the noise from alerts?
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a large free tier as we mainly want feedback. You can
                self-serve under 2 min. I'll be in the thread with my co-founder
                to answer your questions, give more technical details, and take
                your feedback: positive, negative, brutal, everything's
                constructive!

              <p>
                I’ve been experimenting with archive format design and built 6cy
                as a research project.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal is not to replace zip/7z, but to explore: • block-level
                codec polymorphism (different compression per block) •
                streaming-first layout (no global seek required) • better crash
                recovery characteristics • plugin-based architecture so
                proprietary codecs can exist without changing the format
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now this is an experimental v0.x format. The specification
                may still change and compatibility is not guaranteed yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m mainly looking for feedback on the format design rather than
                performance comparisons.
              </p>
              <p>Thanks for taking a look.</p>

              I've been teaching LLMs to play Magic: The Gathering recently, via
              MCP tools hooked up to the open-source XMage codebase. It's still
              pretty buggy and I think there's significant room for existing
              models to get better at it via tooling improvements, but it pretty
              much works today. The ratings for expensive frontier models are
              artificially low right now because I've been focusing on cheaper
              models until I work out the bugs, so they don't have a lot of
              games in the system.

                My favorite languages are Smalltalk and Lisp, but as an Emacs
                user, I've been using the latter for much longer and for my
                current projects, Common Lisp is a better fit, so I call myself
                "a Lisp-er" these days. If people like what I did, I do have
                plans to write some more (but probably only after I retire,
                writing next to a full-time job is heard). Maybe on Smalltalk,
                maybe on computer networks - two topics close to my heart.

              <p>
                For someone who can't always keep it in the fairway, golf balls
                can get rather expensive, so I decided to build a way for me to
                view Amazon listings by how much they cost per ball in the hopes
                of finding some good deals. Hence the name of the website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The site is hosted on Cloudflare pages and I use Github actions
                to trigger a python script that fetches and checks the prices.
                It runs twice a day. If the script encounters any new ASINs, it
                stores them for future checks, so the list of golf balls being
                price checked should keep growing over time. Changes are then
                pushed to Cloudflare pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                There can sometimes be some pricing oddities when the product
                title says one count, but the unit count being returned from
                Amazon is another number, so I'm trying to add some checks to
                help accommodate for that. Right now, I just have some manual
                overrides for certain ASINs, but I'm looking to improve on it in
                the future.
              </p>
              <p>The frontend is just some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
              <p>
                Listings on Amazon can be inconsistent sometimes because, for
                example, product titles will say used balls, but the seller
                lists them as new. I added some filters to that allow you to
                exclude used/recycled balls, plastic golf balls, etc... You can
                also filter by brand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Give it a spin and let me know if you run into any issues or
                have any feature ideas to make it more useful.

                I intentionally leaned towards skeuomorphic design for
                nostalgia. I miss the days where I'd spend hours making a button
                to look like a physical button. Here I chose to make it look
                like a "good enough" Teenage Engineering device UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                I tested/used GPT-5.3-Codex to build this from scratch, since
                there was a lot of hype around it on X. Maybe I wasn’t using it
                right, but I found it needed a lot of code cleanup at every step
                and a lot of hand holding along the way. It missed
                details/nuances and didn't land the skeuomorphic buttons or the
                interaction polish. It mostly helped with boilerplate where
                there wasn't much thinking/detailing. It did give a basic
                starting point for the effect calculations, but didn't really
                move the needle on the details.
              </p>
