              I wanted to share our new speech to text model, and the library to
              use them effectively. We're a small startup (six people, sub-$100k
              monthly GPU budget) so I'm proud of the work the team has done to
              create streaming STT models with lower word-error rates than
              OpenAI's largest Whisper model. Admittedly Large v3 is a couple of
              years old, but we're near the top the HF OpenASR leaderboard, even
              up against Nvidia's Parakeet family. Anyway, I'd love to get
              feedback on the models and software, and hear about what people
              might build with it.

              support tickets, Slack threads, etc.—and automatically drafts doc
              updates when it spots something that should be documented.
              <p>
                Frances and I really appreciated the feedback from our first
                launch. Today we’re launching Promptless 1.0, which addresses
                our biggest learnings from the last 12 months.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also made it way easier to try it out. You can tag @promptless
                on any open-source Github PR or Issue with a doc update request,
                and Promptless will create a fork and open a PR for your docs to
                help. Feel free to use our own docs as a playground:
                <a href="https://github.com/Promptless/docs/issues"
                  >https://github.com/Promptless/docs/issues</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Or, you can sign up at
                <a href="https://promptless.ai">https://promptless.ai</a> to get
                free access for your own docs for the next 30 days. Here's a
                demo video:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/IWwimHCEY7Y"
                  >https://youtu.be/IWwimHCEY7Y</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                For me, the coolest part of the last year has been seeing how
                users got creative with Promptless. One user has Promptless
                listening in to all their Slack Connect channels, so whenever
                they answer a customer question, Promptless figures out if their
                docs should be updated and drafts an update if so. Another user
                has Promptless processing every customer meeting transcript and
                updating their internal docs after each meeting: customer
                dashboards, feature request pages, etc.
              </p>
              <p>Some of the biggest things that are new with version 1.0:</p>
              <p>
                - Automatically updating screenshots: this was by far our most
                requested feature. The need here was always clear. People would
                exclude screenshots from docs because they’d get stale quickly,
                <i
                  >even though they knew screenshots would be helpful to
                  users</i
                >. A year ago, we just couldn't ship a good enough solution, but
                given how much LLMs' visual grounding has improved in the last
                year, now we've got something we're proud of.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Slop-free writing: The most common critique on early
                Promptless suggestions was that even though they were accurate,
                they could sound generic or verbose, or might just reek of AI
                slop. Promptless 1.0 is 3.5x better at this (measured by
                voice-alignment compared to what users actually published),
                through a combination of fine-tuned models, sub-agents, and
                alignment on user-defined preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Open-source program: We're especially proud of this—Promptless
                is now free for CNCF/Linux Foundation projects (reach out if
                you’re a maintainer!). You can take a look at how Promptless is
                supporting Vitess (a CNCF-graduated project) with their docs
                here:

                Emdash is an open-source and provider-agnostic desktop app that
                lets you run multiple coding agents in parallel, each isolated
                in its own git worktree, either locally or over SSH on a remote
                machine. We call it an Agentic Development Environment (ADE).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see a 1 minute demo here:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/X31nK-zlzKo"
                  >https://youtu.be/X31nK-zlzKo</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We are building Emdash for ourselves. While working on a
                cap-table management application (think Stripe Atlas + Pulley),
                we found our development workflow to be messy: lots of
                terminals, lots of branches, and too much time spent waiting on
                Codex.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emdash puts the terminal at the center and makes it easy to run
                multiple agents at once. Each agent runs as a task in its own
                git worktree. You can start one or a few agents on the same
                problem, test, and review.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emdash works over SSH so you can run agents where your code
                lives and keep the parallel workflow. You can assign tickets to
                agents, edit files manually, and review changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also spent time making task startup fast. Each task can be
                created in a worktree, and creating worktrees on demand was
                taking 5s+ in some cases. We now keep a small reserve of
                worktrees in the background and let a new task claim one
                instantly. That brought task start time down to ~500–1000ms
                depending on the provider. We also spawn the shell directly and
                avoid loading the shell environments on startup.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe using the providers’ native CLIs is the right
                approach. It gives you the full capabilities of each agent,
                always. If a provider starts supporting plan mode, we don't have
                to add that first.
              </p>
              <p>
                We support 21 coding agent CLIs today, including Claude Code,
                Codex, Gemini, Droid, Amp, Codebuff, and more. We auto-detect
                what you have installed and we’re provider-agnostic by design.
                If there’s a provider you want that we don’t support yet, we can
                add it. We believe that in the future, some agents will be
                better suited for task X and others for task Y. Codex, Claude
                Code, and Gemini all have fans. We want to be agnostic and
                enable individuals and teams to freely switch between them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond orchestration, we try to pull most of the development
                loop into Emdash. You can review diffs, commit, open PRs, see
                CI/CD checks, and merge directly from Emdash once checks pass.
                When starting a task, you can pass issues from Linear, GitHub,
                and Jira to an agent. We also support convenience variables and
                lifecycle scripts so it’s easy to allocate ports and test
                changes.
              </p>
              <p>Emdash is fully open-source and MIT-licensed.</p>
              <p>
                Download for macOS, Linux or Windows (as of yesterday !), or
                install via Homebrew: brew install --cask emdash.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love your feedback. How does your coding agent development
                setup look like, especially when working with multiple agents?
                We would want to learn more about it. Check out our repository

                We’ve updated the course based on our personal experiences as
                well as major changes in the field (e.g., the proliferation of
                AI-powered developer tools) over the past several years. The
                2026 course includes revised versions of four lectures from the
                previous course, and it adds five entirely new lectures:
              </p>
              <p>- Development Environment and Tools</p>
              <p>- Packaging and Shipping Code</p>
              <p>- Agentic Coding</p>
              <p>- Beyond the Code (soft skills)</p>
              <p>- Code Quality</p>
              <p>
                We’d love to hear any feedback from the HN community to improve
                the current or future iterations of the course. In particular,
                we’re curious to hear the community’s take on our inclusion of
                AI-related topics (e.g., dedicating an entire class to the topic
                of agentic coding; though we tried to counterbalance it with
                plenty of disclaimers, and a dedicated section on AI etiquette
                in Beyond the Code).

                It scales from 1 to n participants, depending on the compute and
                memory of the host system Best part? It’s packaged with Nix, so

                It supports both UDP (with a relay chain for Kubernetes) and
                WebRTC (with containerized TURN servers). Chaos spikes can be
                distributed evenly, randomly, or front/back-loaded for different
                test scenarios. To change this, just edit the values in a single
                config file

                Also, ideally, no requirement of a smartphone to send-receive
                data (it's ok to need a smartphone for the initial setup of the
                watch, though). I know about Pebble, but it doesn't have wifi. I
                know about some Garmins with wifi but for the kind of apps I
                want to write, the communication between the watch and the
                server has to be mediated by a phone. Also, correct me if I'm
                wrong, I don't want to pay $100/year just to be able to use my
                custom app in apple watches. I usually don't trust Google either
                (e.g., they discontinue everything in a blink of an eye).
