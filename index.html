                I wanted to try it myself, but was surprised how hard it was to
                find something free and easy to use to generate such pulses.
                Which is odd because I remember some freeware DOS program I
                tried back in the 90s which did all this kind of stuff (anyone
                know what I’m talking about? Google fails me…).
              </p>
              <p>
                So anyway, I made this tool in a couple hours and put it up as a
                public service so that older people can try this treatment now
                without waiting years for FDA trials to finish and without
                getting a diagnosis and expensive piece of medical equipment.
                The code is available here:
              </p>

                  >https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/anti_alzheimers_flasher</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                As an aside, I first tried making this in Rust, but gave up
                after finding it incredibly annoying to deal with the wgpu
                library with its ever changing and breaking API. This was a
                surprise because I generally find working in Rust to be quite
                pleasant.
              </p>
              <p>
                In contrast, doing it in JS was a total breeze, and I was
                impressed how well canvas and webaudio works nowadays. It also
                makes it easy to add documentation right there on the page, to
                distribute it, and to get it working on mobile phones
                automatically. Web development is pretty awesome!
              </p>
              <p>
                The best part is that, because I made it as a single html file
                on GitHub, I was able to deploy it without even setting up Nginx
                on a machine somewhere— I just used Cloudflare Pages and the
                whole thing took a couple minutes (getting the domain from
                Cloudflare made things even easier since they automatically
                handled everything with the certificate).
              </p>
              <p>
                I realize that there are limitations in using a computer screen
                for precise flashing given hardware refresh rates. I’d certainly
                welcome any PRs if people have ideas about how to improve it or
                make it more efficient without breaking it on mobile. I tried to
                do the flashing in a way that can be easily hardware accelerated
                in modern browsers. The hardest part was getting rid of the
                disconcerting popping artifacts when starting and stopping the
                low frequency audio, but I resolved it by ramping up and down
                the volume beforehand.

              <p>
                1. In college - I started a company and tried convincing a
                couple of really smart friends to join as co-founders.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. They were risk-averse. They wanted a salary. Even though I
                had 0 money, I promised them a salary and asked them to join as
                employees. They agreed.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. I had no money for salaries, but I went into crazy action
                mode and got a couple of B2B clients for a random project I saw
                that people need (even though our main product is B2C as a
                startup and we later on shut this B2B section after we raised).
                I did B2B projects, got a cashflow, and started paying them
                salaries, while I took 0 salary as I reinvested as much as I
                could.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. This went on for like 6 months. And I we were finally able to
                raise $400,000. The I convinced one of the employees to become a
                co-founder. He agreed. Gave him almost equal equity even though
                he joined late after we raised, and he was already taking a
                salary, while I never took a salary until that day. During this
                we also graduated college and started doing this full time.
              </p>
              <p>
                5. We built for 6 months, realized we need more time and
                resources than we realised, and decided to downsize and take pay
                cuts. I took the largest pay cut to maintain the morale of my
                co-founder and team.
              </p>
              <p>
                6. 1 year later, we are still kind of a sinking ship, and we
                have not been able to raise our next round. I also have no
                savings due to my minuscule salary.
              </p>
              <p>
                7. We all pushed hard, and I managed to secure a $220,000 bridge
                round from existing investors
              </p>
              <p>
                8. We are now in the middle of the paperwork to get that money
                in, and finally, there is hope, and I am getting out of my
                depression and headaches after a long time.
              </p>
              <p>
                9. I announced reversal of pay cuts, a new game plan on how we
                will start generating revenue and also raise more soon.
              </p>
              <p>
                10. Co-founder, out of the blue, suddenly says that he wants to
                quit. Says he does not care even if we succeed post the new fund
                round as he wants to switch domains immediately and work on
                another tech domain. He is willing to give most shares back.
              </p>
              <p>
                11. I argued that he still has an employee mindset. Founders
                don't get to quit randomly; we have a responsibility towards
                investors and employees who stuck with us through all this.
              </p>
              <p>
                12. As a co-founder, he has the authority to steer the company
                the way he wants as well, and I am happy to discuss and pivot
                together. My proposal is we see this current thing through,
                spend a few more months with the fresh funding on working on the
                thing the investors put in money for, and if it does not work
                out then pivot. If it works, still pivot with further funding.
              </p>
              <p>
                13. He still wants to quit now as he does not want to work on
                this domain even if we succeed and even if we pivot later.
              </p>
              <p>
                14. I was blindsided as everything seemed great until today.
                Until yesterday we discussed how we are going to build the
                largest company in our current / new domain
              </p>
              <p>
                15. Even today, we are not fighting, there is nothing that
                happened between us, he just had a quarter-life crisis and
                believes his calling is to work in the said new domain, right
                now.
              </p>
              <p>
                16. Even though I can code and have a decent tech background and
                I can manage simple tech stuff, he is genuinely a very smart
                tech guy, and like a prodigy. Losing someone of that level as a
                co-founder is a large blow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pretty sure that our investors will not continue the financing
                now, and without the current financing, I do not have enough
                money to run payroll nor to close the company if required.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before anyone asks - he does have a notice period. But I will
                now have to focus on replacing him instead of focusing on things
                that matter. Also, employees will also be shocked and might
                leave as we are currently a very small team, and as company that
                is already struggling, losing one of its founders will spook the
                employees, and rightly so. They have families to feed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am really sad. I imagined us conquering the world together.
