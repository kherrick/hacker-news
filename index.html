              <p>
                Fast forward to now. I'm a Buffett nerd — big believer in
                compound interest as a mental model for life. I run compound
                interest calculations constantly. Not because I need to, but
                because watching numbers grow over 30-40 years keeps me patient
                when markets get wild. It's basically meditation for long-term
                investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem? Every compound interest calculator online is
                terrible. Ugly interfaces, ads covering half the screen, can't
                customize compounding frequency properly, no year-by-year
                breakdowns. I've tried so many. They all suck.
              </p>
              <p>
                When vibe coding started blowing up, something clicked. Maybe I
                could actually build the calculators I wanted? I don't have to
                be a "real developer" anymore — I just need to describe what I
                want clearly.
              </p>
              <p>So I tried it.</p>
              <p>
                Two weeks and ~$100（Opus 4.5 thinking model） in API costs
                later: I somehow have 60+ calculators. Started with compound
                interest, naturally. Then thought "well, while I'm here..." and
                added mortgage, loan amortization, savings goals, retirement
                projections. Then it spiraled — BMI calculator, timezone
                converter, regex tester. Oops.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AI (I'm using Claude via Windsurf) handled the grunt work
                beautifully. I'd describe exactly what I wanted — "compound
                interest calculator with monthly/quarterly/yearly options,
                year-by-year breakdown table, recurring contribution support" —
                and it delivered. With validation, nice components, even tests.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I realized: my years away from coding weren't wasted. I
                still understood architecture, I still knew what good UX looked
                like, I still had domain expertise (financial math). I just
                couldn't type it all out efficiently. AI filled that gap
                perfectly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vibe coding didn't make me a 10x engineer. But it gave me
                permission to build again. Ideas I've had for years suddenly
                feel achievable. That's honestly the bigger win for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stack: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, four languages
                (EN/DE/FR/JA). The AI picked most of this when I said "modern
                and clean."
              </p>
              <p>
                Site's live at
                <a href="https://calquio.com">https://calquio.com</a> . The
                compound interest calculator is still my favorite page — finally
                exactly what I wanted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Curious if others have similar stories. Anyone else come back to
                building after stepping away?

              <p>
                I've been an avid fan of Pocket Operators by Teenage Engineering
                since I found out about them. I even own an EP-133 K.O. II
                today, which I love.
              </p>
              <p>
                A couple of months ago, Reddit user andiam03 shared a Google
                Sheet with some drum patterns [1]. I thought it was a very cool
                way to share and understand beats.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the weekend I coded a basic version of this app I am
                sharing today. I iterated over it in my free time, and yesterday
                I felt like I had a pretty good version to share with y'all.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's not meant to be a sequencer but rather a way to experiment
                with beats and basic sounds, save them, and use them in your
                songs. It also has a sharing feature with a link.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was built using Tone.js [2], Stimulus [3] and deployed in
                Render [4] as a static website. I used an LLM to read the
                Tone.js documentation and generate sounds, since I have no
                knowledge about sound production, and modified from there.

              >), we've been using it to run AI agents in isolated macOS
              environments. We needed VMs that could set themselves up, so we
              built that.
              <p>Here's what's new in 0.2:</p>
              <p>
                *Unattended Setup* – Go from IPSW to a fully configured VM
                without touching the keyboard. We built a VNC + OCR system that
                clicks through macOS Setup Assistant automatically. No more
                manual setup before pushing to a registry:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe
</code></pre>
              You can write custom YAML configs to set up any macOS version your
              way.
              <p>
                *HTTP API + Daemon* – A REST API on port 7777 that runs as a
                background service. Your scripts and CI pipelines can manage VMs
                that persist even if your terminal closes:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  curl -X POST localhost:7777/lume/vms/my-vm/run -d '{"noDisplay": true}'
</code></pre>
              *MCP Server* – Native integration with Claude Desktop and AI
              coding agents. Claude can create, run, and execute commands in VMs
              directly:
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  # Add to Claude Desktop config
  "lume": { "command": "lume", "args": ["serve", "--mcp"] }
    
  # Then just ask: "Create a sandbox VM and run my tests"
</code></pre>
              *Multi-location Storage* – macOS disk space is always tight, so
              from user feedback we added support for external drives. Add an
              SSD, move VMs between locations:
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  lume config storage add external-ssd /Volumes/ExternalSSD/lume
  lume clone my-vm backup --source-storage default --dest-storage external-ssd
</code></pre>
              *Registry Support* – Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS.
              Create a golden image once, share it across your team.
              <p>
                We're seeing people use Lume for: - Running Claude Code in an
                isolated VM (your host stays clean, reset mistakes by cloning) -
                CI/CD pipelines for Apple platform apps - Automated UI testing
                across macOS versions - Disposable sandboxes for security
                research
              </p>
              <p>To get started:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"

  lume create sandbox --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe
  lume run sandbox --shared-dir ~/my-project
</code></pre>
              Lume is MIT licensed and Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4) since it
              uses Apple's native Virtualization Framework directly—no
              emulation.
              <p>
                Lume runs on EC2 Mac instances and Scaleway if you need cloud
                infrastructure. We're also working on a managed cloud offering
                for teams that need macOS compute on demand—if you're
                interested, reach out.
