              <p>
                About a year ago my wife and I, both closing in on 40, quit our
                jobs at Red Hat to start a games company and learn game
                development. Many things happened along the road, and about a
                week ago we released our first (small) game on Steam.
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/"
                  >https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The demo is free to play up to level 8 (the final game plays up
                to level 80) and we'd appreciate any feedback you have, whether
                it's for the store page or the game itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                We made the game in Godot 4.2 in roughly 3 months and I was
                working full time next to it. Since we ran into a bunch of
                roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up
                as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the
                game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The
                only thing we can't redistribute with the game code is the
                Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam. (The
                game minus integration is fully runnable without the SDK,
                though.)
              </p>
              <p>Cheers and happy weekend!</p>

              The Recovery Kit 2 is another cyberdeck that for me is part
              computer, part backup device, and part functional movie prop. It's
              been fun to build, and the HN community has been great with ideas-
              especially around hosting and getting me off Squarespace. I hope
              you all enjoy!

              <p>
                At a company I worked for, we needed to develop an MVP
                (basically a web page) and apply certain business logic to a
                Google Drive spreadsheet that was frequently updated by the
                Sales team.
              </p>
              <p>In this case, we had two options:</p>
              <p>
                Develop a backend to replace the current spreadsheet and have
                the sales team use it as a new "backoffice" - This would take a
                very long time, and if the hypothesis we were testing was wrong,
                it would be time wasted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create the web page and use Google's SDK to extract data from
                the spreadsheet.
              </p>
              <p>
                We chose to go with the second option because it was quicker.
                Indeed, it was much faster than creating a new backoffice. But
                not as quick as we imagined. Integrating with Google's SDK
                requires some effort, especially to handle the OAuth logic,
                configure it in the console, and understand the documentation
                (which is quite shallow, by the way).
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway! We did the project and I realized that maybe other devs
                might have encountered similar issues. Therefore, I developed a
                tool that transforms Google spreadsheets into "realtime APIs"
                with PATCH, GET, POST, and DELETE methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since it's a product for devs, I think it would be cool to hear
                your opinions. It's still quite primitive, but the basic
                features already work.

                I am aware there are already libraries that can draw to multiple
                contexts interchangeably, but I've added a few little niceties
                to Ripl that (as far as I know) some other libraries don't have
                such as CSS-like query selectors, DOM-like event bubbling, and
                keyframe animation support.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is far from done and not published to NPM yet, but
                there are a few demos and source that you can look at in the
                repo.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm happy with how it has come along and the things I've learnt
                along the way, especially the math. My dream would be to one day
                work on this full-time and build out a full data-viz library.

                I’m excited to introduce ClassroomIO – a project that I’ve been
                working on for the past few months. It’s an educational platform
                that provides an in-browser code editor and execution
                environment. The idea is to make teaching programming easier by
                eliminating the technical barriers that educators and students
                often face.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feature highlights: * In-Browser coding: Write, run, and debug
                code directly in your browser. No more downloading software,
                configuring environments, and resolving compatibility issues. *
                Course management: Manage classes, assignments, and student
                interactions in one place. * Many languages supported: Python,
                Java, JavaScript, C/C++, C#, Go, PHP – more incoming.
              </p>

                Open beta access: I’d love it if interested people could join my
                open beta, explore the platform's capabilities, and provide some
                feedback to help me make it a better tool.
