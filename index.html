            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://trymaitai.ai">https://trymaitai.ai</a>). We're
              building an LLM platform that optimizes request routing,
              autocorrects bad responses, and automatically fine-tunes new
              application-specific models with incremental improvements. Here’s
              a demo video:
              <a
                href="https://www.loom.com/share/a2cd9192359840cab5274ccba399bd87?sid=7097fd84-ea85-42cd-9616-84abc1087a56"
                >https://www.loom.com/share/a2cd9192359840cab5274ccba399bd87?...</a
              >.
              <p>
                If you want to try it out, we built a game (<a
                  href="https://maitaistreasure.com"
                  >https://maitaistreasure.com</a
                >) to show how our real-time autocorrections work with
                mission-critical expectations (like never giving financial
                advice). Try and coax the bot to give you the secret phrase in
                its system prompt. If you're the first to crack it, you can
                email us the phrase and win a bounty. Maitai is used to make
                sure the bot always adheres to our expectations, and thus never
                gives up the secret phrase.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built Maitai because getting an LLM app into production and
                maintaining it is a slog. Teams spend most of their time on LLM
                reliability rather than their main product. We experienced this
                ourselves at our previous jobs deploying AI-enabled applications
                for Presto—the vast majority of time was making sure the model
                did what we wanted it to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, one of our customers builds AI ordering agents for
                restaurants. It's crucial that their LLMs return results in a
                predictable, consistent manner throughout the conversation. If
                not, it leads to a poor guest experience and a staff member may
                intervene. At the end of the order conversation, they need to
                ensure that the order cart matches what the customer requested
                before it's submitted to the Point of Sale system. It's common
                for a human-in-the-loop to review critical pieces of information
                like this, but it’s costly to set up such a pipeline and it’s
                difficult to scale. When it's time to send out a receipt and
                payment link, they must first get the customer's consent to
                receive text messages, else they risk fines for violating the
                Telephone Consumer Protection Act. To boot, getting from 0 to 1
                usually relies on inefficient general-purpose models that aren't
                viable at any sort of scale beyond proof of concept.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since reliability is the #1 thing hindering the adoption of LLMs
                in production, we decided to help change that. Here's how it
                works:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Maitai sits between the client and the LLMs as a super
                lightweight proxy, analyzing traffic to automatically build a
                robust set of expectations for how the LLM should respond.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. The application sends a request to Maitai, and Maitai
                forwards it to the appropriate LLM (user specified, but we'll
                preemptively fallback to a similar model if we notice issues
                with the primary model).
              </p>
              <p>
                3. We intercept the response from the LLM, and evaluate it
                against the expectations we had previously built.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. If we notice that an expectation was not met, we surface a
                fault (Slack, webhook) and can, optionally, substitute the
                faulty response with a clean response to be sent back to the
                client. This check and correction adds about 250ms on average
                right now, and we're working on making it faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                5. We use all of the data from evaluating model responses to
                fine-tune application-specific models. We're working on
                automating this step for passive incremental improvements. We'd
                like to get it to a point where our user's inference step just
                gets better, faster, and cheaper over time without them having
                to do anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our hope is that we take on the reliability and resiliency
                problems of the LLMs for our customers, and make it so they can
                focus on domain specific problems instead.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're self-serve (<a href="https://portal.trymaitai.ai"
                  >https://portal.trymaitai.ai</a
                >), and have both Python and Node SDKs that mock OpenAI's for
                quick integration. Users can set their preferences for primary
                and secondary (fallback) models in our Portal, or in code. Right
                now, the expectations we use for real-time evaluations are
                automatically generated, but we manually go through and do some
                pruning before enabling them. Fine-tuning is all done manually
                for now.
              </p>
              <p>
                We charge for platform usage, plus a monthly application fee.
                Customers can bring their own LLM provider API keys, or use ours
                and pay at-cost for what they use. We have contracts with most
                of our current customers, so we are still trying to figure out
                what's right for our pay-as-you-go plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                We securely store requests and responses that go through Maitai,
                as well as derivative data such as evaluation results. This
                information is used for fine-tuning models, accessible only by
                the organization the data belongs to. Data is never shared
                between our users. API keys we manage on behalf of our customers
                are only injected before sending to the LLM provider, and never
                leave our servers otherwise. We're working on SOC2 and HIPAA
                compliance, as well as a self-hosted solution for companies with
                extremely sensitive data privacy requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love to get your feedback on what we’re building, or hear
                about your experience building around LLMs!

            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://www.lmnr.ai">https://www.lmnr.ai</a>), an
              open-source observability and analytics platform for complex LLM
              apps. It’s designed to be fast, reliable, and scalable. The stack
              is RabbitMQ for message queues, Postgres for storage, Clickhouse
              for analytics, Qdrant for semantic search - all powered by Rust.
              <p>
                How is Laminar different from the swarm of other “LLM
                observability” platforms?
              </p>
              <p>
                On the observability part, we’re focused on handling full
                execution traces, not just LLM calls. We built a Rust ingestor
                for OpenTelemetry (Otel) spans with GenAI semantic conventions.
                As LLM apps get more complex (think Agents with hundreds of LLM
                and function calls, or complex RAG pipelines), full tracing is
                critical. With Otel spans, we can: 1. Cover the entire execution
                trace. 2. Keep the platform future-proof 3. Leverage an amazing
                OpenLLMetry (<a href="https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry"
                  >https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry</a
                >), open-source package for span production.
              </p>
              <p>
                The key difference is that we tie text analytics directly to
                execution traces. Rich text data makes LLM traces unique, so we
                let you track “semantic metrics” (like what your AI agent is
                actually saying) and connect those metrics to where they happen
                in the trace. If you want to know if your AI drive-through agent
                made an upsell, you can design an LLM extraction pipeline in our
                builder (more on it later), host it on Laminar, and handle
                everything from event requests to output logging. Processing
                requests simply come as events in the Otel span.
              </p>
              <p>
                We think it’s a win to separate core app logic from LLM event
                processing. Most devs don’t want to manage background queues for
                LLM analytics processing but still want insights into how their
                Agents or RAGs are working.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Pipeline Builder uses graph UI where nodes are LLM and util
                functions, and edges showing data flow. We built a custom task
                execution engine with support of parallel branch executions,
                cycles and branches (it’s overkill for simple pipelines, but
                it’s extremely cool and we’ve spent a lot of time designing a
                robust engine). You can also call pipelines directly as API
                endpoints. We found them to be extremely useful for iterating on
                and separating LLM logic. Laminar also traces pipeline directly,
                which removes the overhead of sending large outputs over the
                network.
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing missing from all LLM observability platforms right now
                is an adequate search over traces. We’re attacking this problem
                by indexing each span in a vector DB and performing hybrid
                search at query time. This feature is still in beta, but we
                think it’s gonna be crucial part of our platform going forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also support evaluations. We loved the “run everything
                locally, send results to a server” approach from Braintrust and
                Weights &amp; Biases, so we did that too: a simple SDK and nice
                dashboards to track everything. Evals are still early, but we’re
                pushing hard on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our goal is to make Laminar the Supabase for LLMOps - the go-to
                open-source comprehensive platform for all things LLMs / GenAI.
                In it’s current shape, Laminar is just few weeks old and
                developing rapidly, we’d love any feedback or for you to give
                Laminar a try in your LLM projects!

                Google DeepMind and their new startup Isomorphic Labs, are
                expanding into drug discovery. They developed AlphaFold3 as
                their model to accelerate drug discovery and create demand from
                big pharma. They already signed Novartis and Eli Lilly for $3
                billion - Google’s becoming a pharma company! (<a
                  href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kicks-off-2024-with-two-pharmaceutical-collaborations"
                  >https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kick...</a
                >)
              </p>
              <p>
                AlphaFold3 is a biomolecular structure prediction model that can
                do three main things: (1) Predict the structure of proteins; (2)
                Predict the structure of drug-protein interactions; (3) Predict
                nucleic acid - protein complex structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                AlphaFold3 is incredibly important for science because it vastly
                accelerates the mapping of protein structures. It takes one PhD
                student their entire PhD to do one structure. With AlphaFold3,
                you get a prediction in minutes on par with experimental
                accuracy.

                There’s just one problem: when DeepMind published AlphaFold3 in
                May (<a
                  href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w"
                  >https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w</a
                >), there was no code. This brought up questions about
                reproducibility (<a
                  href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01463-0"
                  >https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01463-0</a
                >) as well as complaints from the scientific community (<a
                  href="https://undark.org/2024/06/06/opinion-alphafold-3-open-source/"
                  >https://undark.org/2024/06/06/opinion-alphafold-3-open-sourc...</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                AlphaFold3 is a fundamental advance in structure modeling
                technology that the entire biotech industry deserves to be able
                to reap the benefits from. Its applications are vast, including:
              </p>
              <p>
                - CRISPR gene editing technologies, where scientists can see
                exactly how the DNA interacts with the scissor Cas protein;
              </p>
              <p>
                - Cancer research - predicting how a potential drug binds to the
                cancer target. One of the highlights in DeepMind’s paper is the
                prediction of a clinical KRAS inhibitor in complex with its
                target.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Antibody / nanobody to target predictions. AlphaFold3 improves
                accuracy on this class of molecules 2 fold compared to the next
                best tool.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, no companies can use it since it is under a
                non-commercial license!
              </p>
              <p>
                Today we are releasing the full model trained on single chain
                proteins (capability 1 above), with the other two capabilities
                to be trained and released soon. We also include the training
                code. Weights will be released once training and benchmarking is
                complete. We wanted this to be truly open source so we used the
                Apache 2.0 license.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deepmind published the full structure of the model, along with
                each components’ pseudocode in their paper. We translated this
                fully into PyTorch, which required more reverse engineering than
                we thought!
              </p>
              <p>
                When building the initial version, we discovered multiple issues
                in DeepMind’s paper that would interfere with the training - we
                think the deep learning community might find these especially
                interesting. (Diffusion folks, we would love feedback on this!)
                These include:
              </p>
              <p>
                - MSE loss scaling differs from Karras et al. (2022). The
                weighting provided in the paper does not downweigh the loss at
                high noise levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Omission of residual layers in the paper - we add these back
                and see benefits in gradient flow and convergence. Anyone have
                any idea why Deepmind may have omitted the residual connections
                in the DiT blocks?
              </p>
              <p>
                - The MSA module, in its current form, has dead layers. The last
                pair weighted averaging and transition layers cannot contribute
                to the pair representation, hence no grads. We swap the order to
                the one in the ExtraMsaStack in AlphaFold2. An alternative
                solution would be to use weight sharing, but whether this is
                done is ambiguous in the paper.
              </p>
              <p>
                More about those issues here:
                <a href="https://github.com/Ligo-Biosciences/AlphaFold3"
                  >https://github.com/Ligo-Biosciences/AlphaFold3</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                How this came about: we are building Ligo (YC S24), where we are
                using ideas from AlphaFold3 for enzyme design. We thought open
                sourcing it was a nice side quest to benefit the community.

                For those on Twitter, there was a good thread a few days ago
                that has more information:

                A few shoutouts: A huge thanks to OpenFold for pioneering the
                previous open source implementation of AlphaFold We did a lot of
                our early prototyping with proteinFlow developed by Lisa at
                AdaptyvBio we also look forward to partnering with them to bring
                you the next versions! We are also partnering with Basecamp
                Research to supply this model with the best sequence data known
                to science. Matthew Clark (<a href="https://batisio.co.uk"
                  >https://batisio.co.uk</a
                >) for his amazing animations!
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re around to answer questions and look forward to hearing
                from you!
