              here!
              <p>
                - crowdwave works best on your phone - unless you've got your
                headset and microphone plugged in to your desktop, in which case
                desktop works great too.
              </p>
              <p>Here's the story:</p>
              <p>
                So about six months ago I saw this post on HN
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39910119"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39910119</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://afterthebeep.tel">https://afterthebeep.tel</a>
                is really cool - it's an anonymous voicemail box - you call the
                provided phone the number and leave a message. Blaine - the guy
                who runs the site (eventually) listens to and approves your
                message and writes a headline. It was fun, and I found I kept
                going back to it and listening to the messages. I left a message
                once and several weeks later it appeared on the site. Blaine,
                from comments I read, didn't seem in a hurry to take the site
                much further, which got me thinking...
              </p>
              <p>
                And I simply could not get one question out of my head - "what
                would happen if users could just hit record on their phone,
                instead of having to dial a phone number?".
              </p>
              <p>
                When I get a software idea I get pretty obsessive and that
                question just kept gnawing at me.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, like the any reasonable programmer would, I stopped working
                on the project I had been working on for literally YEARS and
                took a detour. Because that's what you do isn't it - you just
                drop those multiple years of work and pick up the shiny new
                thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I saw that afterthebeep is open source and I loved the UI design
                - the Windows 3.1 aesthetic really appealed to me - it seems
                perfect for voicemail, so I grabbed the open source code and
                started development. I couldn't make much sense of the code - it
                was using tech I'm not familiar with, so I ditched it all except
                the layout and the graphics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, the project I had been working on for YEARS is
                basically a Twitter/Reddit clone, so I ripped the UI out of the
                afterthebeep open source project and did open heart surgery
                until like some bizarre Frankenstein's monster I had put the
                afterthebeep open source UI onto my code.
              </p>
              <p>
                And I added in the functionality that I craved so much - a
                "record" button. Sigh.... relief. It was incredibly satisfying
                to hit record and see a message appear almost immediately. Nerd
                craving fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p>
                But my satisfaction did not last long. I REALLY HAD TO fix that
                problem of getting the posts approved and headlines written. So
                I made a back end audio processing pipeline and fed the messages
                into an LLM, which ripped the text from the speech and I then
                shoved it into OpenAI and asked it to make nice headlines. And
                it worked beautifully - now you only have to wait 30 seconds to
                see your message with a nice headline! Ahhhh..... sigh,
                satisfaction... (it wouldn't be 2024 without an AI twist, would
                it now?).
              </p>
              <p>
                But hang on! It would be <i>SO much better</i> if there was some
                sort of category system almost like subreddits - then people
                could post their messages into areas of interest. So I built the
                channel system and sat back.... job done.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking at the calendar, dreading to see..... I've dropped into
                obsessive coding mode and and I've been down this rabbit hole
                full time for MONTHS. I'm getting wary - and I'm also getting
                tired and sick of the effort - when's this going to end?
              </p>
              <p>
                But wait, another idea! How much more cool would it be if you
                could have your own user account, and follow and like and
                subscribe! I've just GOT TO make that. AND surely it has to be
                multi language doesn't it? I mean Germans like talking too don't
                they? And user profile pics, and channel banner images, and
                options and settings. And if you don't put in terms and
                conditions and privacy and a cookie message then won't the
                Eurpoeans turn up and arrest me? At this stage I'm like a
                drunken junkie wanting just one more thing, one more thing......
                scope ain't just creeping, the scope is up and racing away
                faster than Usain Bolt.

                I'm now like nearly five months into this and packing all this
                functionality into a UI that both make sense and fits onto a
                tiny phone screen is becoming a huge challenge - a challenge I
                don't know if I can actually solve - and if I can't make the UI
                make sense then the whole thing will be unusable. The UI MUST be
                minimal and yet still reveal to the user pretty much everything
                within fewer than five pages in total. The UI had to work BEST
                on a phone. That was a HUGE challenge, and I really didn't know
                until the end of the project if I could do it at all. But
                finally the UI seemed to come together and it was a tight
                squeeze but fit onto the limited screen resolution of even my
                old iPhone 6s (yes it's my main phone).
              </p>

                Then, a few days ago, after many months of grueling grind, there
                was nothing left on the todo list. crowdwave was done! All the
                features were done and I'd finally chased down that scope creep.

              <p>
                We are Michael &amp; Jono, and we are building Cerebrium (<a
                  href="https://www.cerebrium.ai"
                  >https://www.cerebrium.ai</a
                >), a serverless infrastructure platform for ML/AI applications
                - we make it easy for engineers to build, deploy and scale AI
                applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initially, we’ve been hyper-focused on the inference side of
                applications, but we’re working on expanding our functionality
                to support training and data processing use cases—eventually
                covering the full AI development lifecycle.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>How we got here:</p>
              <p>
                Jono and I led the technical team at our previous e-commerce
                startup, which grew rapidly over a few years. As we scaled, we
                were tasked with building out ML applications to make the
                business more efficient. It was tough—every day felt like a
                defeat. We found ourselves stitching together AWS Lambda,
                Sagemaker, and Prefect jobs (this stack alone was enough to make
                me want to give up). By the time we reached production, the
                costs were too high to maintain. Getting these applications live
                required a significant upfront investment of both time and
                money, making it inaccessible for most startups and scale-ups to
                attempt. We wanted to create something that would help us (and
                others like us) implement ML/AI applications easily and
                cost-effectively.
              </p>
              <p>The problem:</p>
              <p>
                There are a ton of challenges to tackle to realize our vision,
                but we’ve initially focused on a few key ones:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. GPUs are expensive – An A100 is 326 times the cost of a CPU,
                and companies are using LLMs like they’re simple APIs.
                Serverless instances solve this to an extent, but minimizing
                cold starts is difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Local development – Engineers need local development
                environments to iterate quickly, but production-grade GPUs
                aren’t available on consumer hardware. How can we make cloud
                deployments feel as fast as just saving a file locally and
                retrying?
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Cost to experiment - To run experiments we had to spin up EC2
                instances each day, recreate our environment and run scripts. It
                was difficult to monitor logs, instance usage metrics as well as
                run large processing jobs or scale endpoints without a
                significant infrastructure investment. Additionally, we often
                forget to switch off instances which cost us money!
              </p>
              <p>Our Approach</p>
              <p>
                We have three core areas that we are focused on which we believe
                are the most important for any infrastructure platform:
              </p>
              <p>1. Performance:</p>
              <p>
                We have worked hard to get our added network latency &lt;50ms
                and the cold start of our average workloads to 2-4 seconds. Here
                are a few things we did to get our cold starts so low:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Container Runtime: We built our own container runtime that
                splits container images into two parts—metadata and data blobs.
                Metadata provides the file structure, while the actual data
                blobs are fetched on-demand. This allows containers to start
                before the full image is downloaded. In the background, we
                prefetch the remaining blobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Caching: Once an image is on a machine, it’s cached for future
                use. This makes subsequent container startups much faster. We
                also intelligently route requests to machines where the image is
                already cached.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Efficient Inference: We route requests to the optimal
                machines, prioritizing low-latency and high-throughput
                performance. If no containers are immediately available, we
                efficiently queue the requests through our task scheduling
                system.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Distributed Storage Cache: One of the most resource-intensive
                parts of AI workloads is loading models into VRAM. We use NVME
                drives (which are much faster than network volumes), as close as
                possible to the machines and we orchestrate workloads to nodes
                that already contain the necessary model weights where possible.
              </p>
              <p>2. Developer Experience</p>
              <p>
                We built Cerebrium to help developers iterate as quickly as
                possible by streamlining the entire build and deployment
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                To get build times as low as possible, we use high-performance
                machines and cache layers where possible. We've reduced
                first-time build times to an average of 2 minutes and 24
                seconds, with subsequent builds completing in just 19 seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also offer a wide range of GPU types—over 8 different
                options—so you can easily test performance and cost efficiency
                by adjusting a single line in your configuration file.
              </p>
              <p>
                To reduce friction, we’ve kept things simple. There are no
                custom Python decorators, no Cerebrium specific syntax to learn.
                You just add a .toml file to define your hardware requirements
                and environment settings. This makes migrating onto or off our
                platform just as easy as migrating off. We aim to impress you
                enough that you will want to stay.
              </p>
              <p>3. Stability</p>
              <p>
                This is arguably more important than the first two areas - no
                one wants to get an email at 11pm at night or on a Saturday that
                their application is down or degraded. Since April, we’ve
                maintained 99.999% uptime. We have redundancies in place,
                monitoring, alerts, and a team that covers all time zones to
                resolve any issues quickly.
              </p>
              <p>Why Is This Hard?</p>
              <p>
                Building Cerebrium has been challenging because it involves
                solving multiple interconnected problems. It requires
                optimization at every step—from efficiently splitting images to
                fetching data on-demand without introducing latency, handling
                distributed caching, optimizing our network stack, and ensuring
                redundancies, all while holding true to the three areas
                mentioned above.
              </p>
              <p>Pricing:</p>
              <p>
                We charge you exactly for the resources you need and only charge
                you when your code is running ie: usage-based. For example, if
                you specify you need 1 A100 GPU, with 2 CPUs and 12 GB of RAM we
                charge you exactly for that and not a full A100 (12 CPU’s and
                148GB of memory)
              </p>
