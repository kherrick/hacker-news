                We’re Adrian, Katon, and Jeremy from PointOne (<a
                  href="https://pointone.ai"
                  >https://pointone.ai</a
                >). We’re building an app that automatically figures out what
                lawyers are doing and generates timesheets for them. Here’s a
                quick demo:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/yrL3e1hgaNc"
                  >https://youtu.be/yrL3e1hgaNc</a
                >, and here’s an even quicker one:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/giIaAxZp2M0"
                  >https://youtu.be/giIaAxZp2M0</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’ve ever hired a lawyer, you know most of them bill by the
                hour—or more specifically, by the 0.1 of an hour (hence our
                name!). What most clients don’t realize is how painful it is for
                lawyers to track all their work in 6-minute increments. Lawyers
                hate time tracking, and many say it’s the worst part of their
                jobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adrian started out his career as a corporate lawyer at Fenwick
                &amp; West. The first thing he was taught was how to track and
                bill his time. Between the 70-hour work weeks and billing to
                10-15+ clients per day, staying on top of timesheets is
                surprisingly hard. To make things worse, law firms are extremely
                particular about how narratives (that is, descriptions of tasks
                performed) are crafted—down to the punctuation and diction
                required. So, Adrian became chronically delinquent in submitting
                his timesheets, and the firm threatened to take away his bonus
                multiple times as a result.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attorney time tracking is not a new problem, and companies have
                been promising to solve it for years. But pre-LLM attempts at
                automatic timekeeping never worked as advertised. We were
                inspired by products like Rewind, and felt that a narrower
                vertical application could finally solve this problem for
                lawyers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our product is a desktop application that a lawyer turns on at
                the start of their work day. It runs passively in the background
                and captures logs from everywhere they work: the OS itself,
                Word, Excel, calendar, emails, web browser, Slack/Teams, etc. We
                then clean, pre-process, and interpret the logs. Modern LLMs
                enable a bunch of cool features. For example, we can pull subtle
                context from an attorney’s browser activity to associate that
                work with a client. And for each client and project, we use
                these models to generate a time entry with a narrative
                description that matches both the firm’s and the client’s style
                preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides the fact that lawyers hate timekeeping, using PointOne
                lets them be sure that they’re not letting time slip through the
                cracks, and frees up hours per week they can spend on other
                things. It also helps firm leadership by getting more consistent
                narratives, and faster timesheet submission.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given the sensitivity of the data captured, privacy and security
                are massively important. As such, we have customizable data
                retention periods, we do not use firm data to update models, and
                we encrypt all data (in addition to employing other standard
                practices for processing confidential data).
              </p>
              <p>
                Since our app primarily works for legal workflows, it might not
                be super useful for <i>most</i> people here (maybe some
                though!). We would love it if you could check out our demo
                video, leave your thoughts in the comments, and introduce us to
                any lawyers you know.

              <p>
                Over the last several years, we’ve noticed that it’s getting
                increasingly difficult to stay in flow. We believe it’s because
                chat (i.e. Slack, Teams, and similar tools) has evolved into
                something it wasn’t designed for. Chat originally served as a
                way to free us from our desk by giving us the safety that if we
                were needed for immediate matters, people could reach us. Now
                it’s become a dumping ground for all communication: daily
                updates, product and engineering discussions, announcements,
                etc. Both of us still reminisce about the days of in-office
                work, before Slack became mainstream, where everyone abided by
                the headphone rule—the unwritten pact that headphones meant
                someone was in deep work and not to bother them unless you
                really needed to. Compared to then, the onus has now shifted to
                be on us to determine which chats are urgent and should take us
                out of flow vs. which messages can be responded to later. It
                feels like the very tool that was meant to liberate us instead
                made us beholden to its pings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Patchwork is our attempt to solve this problem by shifting the
                primary communication model from group chats to feeds. Posts are
                made in relevant groups and each team member has a home feed
                personalized to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The feed algorithm evaluates each post's relevance and urgency
                based on a bunch of factors, including the post’s content,
                user's role, ongoing projects, and recent interactions. Our goal
                is to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio with our feed’s
                algorithm so we can surface the most important information
                first. When you’re not in flow or in between meetings, you can
                check the feed to stay in sync.
              </p>
              <p>
                There have been feed-based work communication products before,
                but they’ve often overlooked the fact that writing a post has
                more friction than writing a chat message, which is why people
                often revert back to doing everything over chat. We’re combating
                this by using LLMs to create a better writing experience (ie.
                generate title and tl;dr, simplify selected content, change the
                tone, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                As a product team ourselves, we know that much of our work
                happens on different platforms. We’re building integrations with
                the likes of Github, Linear, Figma, GSuite etc. Having all of
                this activity from different platforms also rolling into our
                feeds allows us to stay in sync with all the different work
                being done on our team instead of having to check various
                sources of data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, we do have chat on the platform, but chat looks and
                feels like chat. It’s meant to be used for immediate needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a demo of the product:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA3rmSjNjDw"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA3rmSjNjDw</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Since it’s a team communication product, it's hard to use it in
                single player mode, so we don’t have a “try it now” link to jump
                straight in. But you’re welcome to email us at
                hackernews@atpatchwork.com and we’ll onboard your team.
              </p>
              <p>
                The product is still early with a basic feed, a few
                integrations, and simple LLM assisted post creation, but the
                main flow is already there, so if the message resonates with
                you, we’d love for you to give it a try.
              </p>
              <p>
                More importantly, we’d love to hear your ideas about team
                communication and getting it back to working <i>for</i> people,
                not <i>at</i> them!

              I'm enthralled with using pen plotters to make generative art.
              Last August at SIGGRAPH, I built an interactive experience for
              others to see how code can be used to make visual art. The linked
              blog post is my trials and tribulations of linking a MIDI
              controller to one of these algorithms and sending its output to a
              plotter, so that people may witness the end-to-end experience.

                I’d love to introduce Figr Identity, which helps you generate
                design systems with variables, styles, Styles sheets and custom
                components in your design language. We built this plugin to take
                away the non-creative work from the design system setup process.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Setup the design tokens: Colours, typography, corner radius,
                spacing system, grids and elevation.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Setup the component Library: All the design tokens are
                automatically reflected in custom component library.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Export to Figma: Get the style guideline, variables, and
                component library to your file in a single click.
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love to hear your feedback as we continue to improve the
                plugin :)

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                When I was studying at MIT, I often had to wait 40-60 minutes in
                line just to get 5 minutes of “help” from a TA - when I needed
                1-2 hours. I understood that TAs can’t spend all their time
                helping me. That’s understandable. But what made me bitter was
                that, the school went the extra mile to ensure I don’t have the
                resources to learn on my own,
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Blocking access to solutions for past problems (to prevent
                cheating)
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Purposely not recording explanations to increase attendance:
                https://piazza.com/class/ky0jj3k89mz5d2/post/9
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Insisting that Office Hours is a 1-by-1 format even when
                crowded (to prevent solutions from leaking)
              </p>
              <p>
                These policies have good intentions - it’s to encourage a
                synchronous, in-person learning experience. But in practice, it
                had side-effects:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Help resources become inefficient - because so much material
                is restricted, and so much time is spent on delivering live
                lectures, there’d often be 40 students competing for help from 2
                TAs in a 2-hour Office Hours
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Because help resources are inefficient, it’s very hard to
                catch-up: once you fall behind, you have no way to review past
                material efficiently enough to compensate the difference - like
                credit card debt
              </p>
              <p>
                3.Every day, I’d wake up, go to a lecture I don’t understand, go
                to Office Hours so I can hopefully ask for a review (which’d
                would take a few hours), realize TAs aren’t willing to do that,
                then realize there is nothing I can do to recover. I fell into a
                depression for many years, and my bitterness fueled me to work
                on the early versions of explanations.app
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out that universities succeed by being prestigious, not
                by teaching well. To win at prestige, be highly selective (by
                keeping supply low), keep a huge endowment (because it affects
                school rankings), and hire the best researchers (not teachers).
                This is actually the fundamental reason for the odd incentives
                in higher education, and something felt wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
                So explanations.app is completely inspired by KhanAcademy and
                Youtube. The mystery to me was - why weren’t there more Youtube
                teachers &amp; KhanAcademy videos? I believe it’s a combination
                of:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. People who teach college subjects well often have better
                opportunities e.g. work, research
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Lack of rewards: even Youtubers with 100K views and 10K
                subscribers would have at most 1-5 paying members on Patreon
              </p>
              <p>
                On the one hand, there are all these free resources, where
                teachers changed the world way more than they ever got rewarded
                for. Then on the other hand, there is private tutoring - very
                effective - but very expensive e.g. $100/hour for college level
                subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe the balanced solution is a system where lots of
                students pay $10/week to a few teachers who make videos, like a
                paid, Q&amp;A Youtube/KhanAcademy, so it’s personalized,
                effective, but still affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are currently 2 teachers on explanations.app - Ben &amp;
                Esther - both MIT grads, teaching physics &amp; math for
                subjects like linear algebra and electromagnetism. 3 students -
                Laquazia, Lidija and Chandra from US, Serbia and Korea joined
                this month following r/physicsStudents launch:
                [https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1b2t5u6/i_started_a_program_where_mit_grads_do_physics/]
              </p>
              <p>
                While explanations.app is focused on college-level math and
                physics, the platform is completely open for anyone to learn
                and/or teach. I hope you can try it :^) and give me the chance
                to work with you.
