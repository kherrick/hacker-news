              <p>
                With CoScreen 5.0, you can now share your windows from multiple
                displays at the same time, a long standing request by our most
                avid users and impossible in other apps. It also has a
                lightning-fast, Rust-based window compositing, scaling, and
                streaming engine now.
              </p>
              <p>
                CoScreen was always meant to be different so that you and your
                team can share your screens simultaneously and
                multi-directionally, and to be able to control what is being
                shared. We saw it as a natural extension and closely coupled
                with your OS — instant, fast, and seamless. A better way to pair
                program, debug tough incidents, or jam on great ideas by sharing
                multi-modal information like code, commands, graphs, or logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                All that made a lot of sense conceptually but to be frank, it
                was hard to get it right. Now a part of Datadog and with major
                parts of our app rewritten in Rust, we feel we’re closer than
                ever.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s what pair programmers liked about CoScreen, so we made it
                even better: - High definition code sharing: Windows are
                video-streamed in real-time at their native resolution whenever
                possible. You never have to search for your IDE anymore or be
                anxious to share the wrong window. - Multi-directional
                collaboration: You can share, while Alice shares, while Bob
                shares. Side-by-side, across multiple displays. With built-in
                crisp audio and video chat. - 60FPS+ super smooth mouse
                pointers. Type, click, and draw on any shared window as if it
                was your own.
              </p>
              <p>
                What some of you did NOT like, so we fixed it in CoScreen V5: -
                CPU utilization and latency have been reduced drastically as
                various parts of our desktop client are now implemented in Rust,
                building on crates such as cxx, rust-skia, iced, as well as Neon
                for our native remote control plugins. - No more accidental
                clicking into remote windows through the new remote window
                toggles. - You’re no longer bound by your displays, can share
                windows from multiple of them at the same time and even move
                them across displays while sharing without stopping. - You’ll
                also soon be able to join meetings from your browser from any
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                CoScreen runs on macOS (x64 and Apple Silicon), Windows, soon
                also on the web and is currently free. We’re planning to charge
                for larger teams and enterprise features in the future.
                Hopefully - finally - we’ll also have a Linux version one day.
                Tell us if you need it urgently and if you have any other
                requirements!

                That lack of transparency would be frightening, but hey, things
                could still work out, right?
              </p>
              <p>Well, let's up the difficulty.</p>
              <p>
                Imagine that, on top of not knowing exactly how much you were
                paying for your <i>inputs</i>, you also didn't know if you would
                have consistent and continued <i>access</i> to your wholesaler,
                your food supplier, or your building materials. That would
                almost certainly induce high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and
                mild insomnia.

                credit for the majority of companies), it's not only normal but
                <i>expected</i> that getting and maintaining access to debt
                capital (one of the key inputs for running any business!) will
                be opaque, error-prone, and hard to operationalize. In other
                words, capital uncertainty is the dismal reality in
                middle-market finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Private credit is enormous (add up all the VC dollars spent last
                year and you'd still be short of the amount of private credit
                issued over the same period), unavoidable, and broken.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means credit access--the fuel or primary
                <i>financial input</i> for most medium-sized businesses--is hard
                to price, access, report on, and predict.
              </p>
              <p>
                And yet it doesn't have to be that way; the data and operational
                issues of private credit have been solved in other domains
                (e.g., CRMs for Sales, infrastructure tooling for devs, EMRs for
                hospitals). What's missing is a software layer for business
                finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finley has built the system of record for private credit. We
                plug into all borrower source systems and automate reporting and
                analysis for private credit lenders. The result is full
                transparency into the <i>cost</i> and <i>availability</i> of
                capital, which gives businesses newfound financial
                predictability.
              </p>

                We're two years into our journey, recently raised a $17 million
                Series A, and already managing over $3 billion in private
                credit.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's still Day 1, though. The challenges we're taking on will
                reshape the economy over the next decades, and we'd love to
                partner with team members who share our passion for innovation
                and company-building.

              We're building a unified backend for LLM apps, where you can
              manage your data, prompts, embeddings, and deployments. Demo video
              here:
              <a

              <p>
                Most LLM apps can be built by properly integrating LLMs with a
                knowledge base consisting of domain-specific or company-specific
                data. The scope of this knowledge base can change based on the
                task- it can be something as narrow and static as your API docs
                or as broad and fluid as meeting transcripts from your customer
                support calls.
              </p>
              <p>
                To effectively use their data, most teams need to build a
                similar stack—datasource integrations, async embedding jobs,
                vector databases, bucket storage for non textual data, a way to
                version prompts, and potentially an additional database for the
                text data. Baseplate provides much of the backend for you
                through simple APIs, so you can focus on building your core
                product and less on building common infra.
              </p>
              <p>
                At my previous role at Google X, I worked on building data
                infrastructure for geospatial data pipelines and knowledge
                graphs. One of my projects was to integrate knowledge graph
                triples with LaMDA, and I discovered the need for LLM tooling
                after using one of Google's initial prompt chaining tools. Ani
                was a PM at Logitech, shipping products in their Computer Vision
                team, and at the same time building side projects with GPT-3.
              </p>
              <p>
                The core of Baseplate is our simplified multimodal database,
                which allows you to store text, embeddings, data, and metadata
                in one place. Through a spreadsheet-style interface, you can
                edit your vectors and metadata (which is surprisingly complex
                with existing tools), and add images that can be returned at
                query time. Users can choose between standard semantic search or
                hybrid search (weighted keywords/semantics for larger, more
                technical datasets). Hybrid search on Baseplate utilizes two
                open-source models that can be tuned for your use case
                (instructor &amp; SPLADE). Datasets are organized into
                documents, which you can keep in sync through our API or through
                the UI (this way you can keep your datasets fresh when ingesting
                data from Google Drive/Notion/ etc).
              </p>
              <p>
                After your datasets are set up, we have an App Builder where you
                can iterate on prompts with input variables, and create context
                variables that pull directly from a dataset at query time. We
                give you all the knobs and dials, so that you can configure
                exactly how your search is performed and how it is integrated
                with your prompt.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you're satisfied with an app configuration, you deploy it
                to an endpoint. All you need is a single API call and we'll pull
                from one (or multiple) datasets in your app and inject the text
                into the prompt. We also return all the search results in the
                API response, so you can build a custom UX around images or
                links in your dataset. Endpoints have built in utilities for
                human feedback and logging. With GPT-4 being able to take images
                as input, we will soon be working on a way to pipe images from
                your dataset directly to the model. And all of these tools are
                in a team workspace, where you can quickly iterate and build
                together.

              <a href="https://noya.io">https://noya.io</a>), a product design
              tool that lets everyone design like a designer. Here’s a video:
              <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910"
                >https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910</a
              >.
              <p>
                Getting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing
                tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too
                low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other
                hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced
                skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out
                a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to
                make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more
                designers is time-consuming and expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                David and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we
                realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their
                knowledge (e.g. design rules and components) into a tool, then
                let non-designers (PMs, marketing, engineers) use that tool to
                make new screens and features. This helps remove design as a
                bottleneck for a lot of product development. We built such tools
                at Airbnb, and with Noya we’re building them for product teams
                everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Current design tools are too freeform for non-designers to
                design great products. They let you do anything, like draw
                rectangles and move text blocks anywhere, so it's easy to mess
                things up, introduce inconsistencies, and so on. With Noya,
                designers set up "guardrails" in the form of a design system
                (rules and components for a company's design), then
                non-designers work within those constraints. This makes it
                harder to mess up and quicker to build something that fits in
                with your product. Footguns begone!
              </p>
              <p>
                It all starts with wireframing, i.e. drawing a minimal layout
                that shows the elements that would exist on the screen. Noya
                combines wireframes and design systems to generate high-fidelity
                designs and code. If you have an idea for a user interface, you
                can use Noya to quickly wireframe that idea by clicking and
                dragging to place blocks for each element of your user
                interface. For each block, choose a type and provide any content
                that goes inside it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the rules and component library of the design system
                you select, Noya automatically turns your wireframe into a
                high-fidelity design. This design can be exported to design
                files, to Figma or Sketch, or to React code.
              </p>
              <p>
                (If you’re curious what the React code looks like, try exporting
                and take a look! There’s plenty of room for improvement,
                especially around responsive layouts, but we think it’s a
                reasonable starting point. The code export is configurable on a
                per-design-system basis so that it’s closer to a company’s
                preferred standards).
              </p>
              <p>
                Most tools in this space are optimized for either low-fidelity
                wireframes that are quick to create (e.g. Balsamiq), or
                high-fidelity output that’s slow to create (e.g. Figma). We
                think there’s a gap in the market for a great wireframing tool
                that produces a high-fidelity output quickly. For example,
                two-thirds of Figma users are non-designers. While there are
                many valid reasons for a non-designer to use Figma, there’s
                often a lot of upfront effort required to learn the tool and set
                up components. We think there should be a lower-effort way for
                non-designers to create high-fidelity designs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on feedback from our Show HN (<a

                Startup founders and PMs have used Noya to build landing pages,
                dashboards, and other flows of their apps. We have some
                templates on our site (<a href="https://noya.io/templates"
                  >https://noya.io/templates</a
                >) that give examples of what people commonly build in Noya. We
                use Noya ourselves, and have been surprised by how frustrating
                it was to go back to existing design tools after using even the
                earliest prototypes of Noya. Existing design tools just aren’t
                built for the comprehensive design systems that products are
                based on today.

                Noya currently supports one design system based on Chakra UI.
                We’re adding additional design systems soon, including Material
                Design, as well as the ability to import custom design systems.
                If your company has an open source design system and you’re
                interested in trying Noya with it, we may be able to integrate
                your design system for free. Get in touch if you’re interested -
