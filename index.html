            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I am currently trapped in a job I don't want. I can't get out
                because it's really hard for me to either find work locally, or
                find a job that I can even tolerate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Question: How do you escape a job when you have no energy to
                keep going? When you are mentally breaking down but still have
                to keep going because society doesn't care about damaged people?
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm also dealing with a midlife crisis so that's certainly a
                variable.
              </p>
              <p>
                My bigger issue is this: It takes ALL of my executive function
                to force myself to do a job I hate all day long. I have nothing
                left in the tank at the end of the day. My entire life is
                collapsing and I am having a bit of a breakdown / panic attack
                because it took me YEARS to find this job during one of the most
                stressful periods of my life. The idea of job hunting again is
                just... no. I honestly think I'd rather die... its upsetting to
                see myself type this but I do not know how else to get out of
                this fifty foot hole that is (the wreckage of) my career.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took the job to keep my marriage going. Now I lost my wife,
                the house is gone... I am living alone in an apartment by
                myself... isolated all the time... doing a job I hate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The job COULD be good but it was terribly misrepresented in the
                JD and the way the org behaves towards software development is
                not professional to put it mildly. I work in a very corporate
                environment that sees software dev as an annoying fly in the
                room vs another person at the table.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                For the last 8 months we've been working on leaflet.pub, a web
                app for making delightful documents. We're trying to strike a
                balance between Notion and Google Docs — very fast, ultralight
                and easy to share, but also supporting rich blocks and multiple
                pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Weirdly, none of the many notetaking/document apps that we could
                find hit this combination, so we made Leaflet. With it you can:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Instantly create a doc, without an account - Share read and
                edit links - Sign-in with email to sync your docs to different
                devices - Add rich blocks, like canvases, subpages, rsvps, and
                polls
              </p>
              <p>
                It's really useful for one-off collaborations, running events,
                or just when you need a blank page without having to buy into a
                whole organizational system.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also spent a lot of time making sure Leaflets look good.
                We've found that there's a pretty blurry boundary between a
                document and a website, so making something that people can feel
                proud to publish online was key.
              </p>
              <p>Here's a couple examples!</p>
              <p>
                - Jake's presentation on Slöjd, traditional handcraft pedagogy
                (<a
                  href="https://leaflet.pub/3d28b4a7-3703-4ae5-aaf6-d270ffe1151f"
                  >https://leaflet.pub/3d28b4a7-3703-4ae5-aaf6-d270ffe1151f</a
                >) - Laura's documentation of her website redesign (<a
                  href="https://leaflet.pub/14aba696-e894-440a-9d06-917641a2bfce"
                  >https://leaflet.pub/14aba696-e894-440a-9d06-917641a2bfce</a
                >)
              </p>
              <p>Some technical details that might be interesting:</p>
              <p>
                - We do sync and all our client-side state via Replicache, which
                I really love! - Data is modeled as a set of facts about
                entities, a la Datomic, forming a graph. This has been flexible
                enough for us to quickly build new features, like canvases and
                nested pages, without committing to a single document structure.
                - We use ProseMirror, but not for the entire document. Instead
                every text block is a separate ProseMirror instance. This lets
                us keep the document structure in our database and our schema,
                without having to dive into ProseMirror's every time we want to
                modify things.
              </p>

                if you want to dig deeper!
              </p>
              <p>On the horizon:</p>
              <p>
                - Better home and document organizing features — things like
                search, tagging, collections etc. - We're really excited about
                ATProto and Bluesky and are working on a set of lexicons and an
                AppView for document publishing! This will include a lexicon for
                rich text documents, as well as one publications, and some
                concept of memberships or subscriptions. - More blocks! Tables,
                code blocks, etc.
              </p>
              <p>Some things we're particularly proud of:</p>
              <p>
                - Our list handling - Custom theming - Keyboard handling on iOS
                Safari (and generally works excellently on mobile) -
                Side-scrolling multi-page interface - Works as a PWA!
              </p>
              <p>Some things that still need work:</p>
              <p>
                - While faster than others, still a lot of work we can do on
                performance, both speed when working with very large documents
                and loading docs generally - Drag and drop and selection in
                general could be a lot nicer - Keyboard navigation across
                multiple pages - Multiplayer cursors, and generally real-time
                sync could be sped up greatly leveraging CRDTs (we already use
                YJS, just could move updates around faster)
              </p>
              <p>
                You can create a new document just by visiting
                <a href="https://leaflet.pub">https://leaflet.pub</a> (or
                <a href="https://leaflet.pub/new">https://leaflet.pub/new</a> if
                you're signed in) — would love to hear your thoughts and any
                feedback if you give it a try!
