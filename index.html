            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I spent the past year building this in my spare time because I
                got tired of enterprise security tools that cost $50K/year and
                don't understand Linux.
              </p>
              <p>
                TheProtector is a comprehensive security monitoring tool that
                actually runs on the systems we use (Linux) instead of being a
                Windows-first afterthought. Built it entirely on a $500 laptop
                because I believe good security shouldn't require unlimited
                budgets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Features: - Real-time process, network, and file monitoring -
                YARA malware detection with custom rules - eBPF kernel
                monitoring (when available) - Behavioral baseline establishment
                and anomaly detection - Active threat response (blocks IPs,
                kills processes, quarantines files) - Anti-evasion detection for
                rootkits and advanced threats - Honeypots for attack detection -
                Web dashboard for monitoring - Single bash script, no complex
                installation
              </p>
              <p>
                The tagline is "not perfect but better than most" because I'm
                tired of security vendors claiming their tools are flawless.
                This actually works, costs $0, and you can read every line of
                code.
              </p>
              <p>
                I know bash isn't the sexy choice for security tools, but it
                runs everywhere, has zero dependencies, and most Linux admins
                can read/modify it. Sometimes boring technology that works is
                better than fancy technology that doesn't.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's designed for the intersection of "paranoid about security"
                and "don't have enterprise budgets" - which describes most of us
                actually running Linux systems.
              </p>

                Been running it on my own systems for months. Catches the stuff
                that matters and doesn't flood you with false positives. If you
                hate expensive security theater as much as I do, might be worth
                a look.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open to feedback, especially from folks who know more about this
                stuff than I do.

              <p>
                I built Bookhead because I used to work as a bookseller and I
                wasn't happy with the software options when I decided to sell my
                own collection online (with the hopes of one day growing so I
                can open my own brick &amp; mortar). So I decided to make my own
                bookselling app...a classic hacker distraction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bookhead has two main parts: 1. an inventory management app that
                allows a bookseller to list their books anywhere they want to
                sell books (like Squarespace, Biblio, eBay, Shopify (coming
                soon!), etc) 2. an e-commerce platform with a CMS for selling
                books and letting a store control their online brand
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a very exciting roadmap that I'm not ready to fully
                reveal, but it's all based on books. I'm building a sorta
                Zapier-like platform for independent booksellers. Everything is
                so fragmented and disconnected, which makes it hard for
                booksellers to do their work. I'm hoping to change that. I have
                a blog post that lays out my vision here:
                <a href="https://bookhead.net/blog/fragmented/"
                  >https://bookhead.net/blog/fragmented/</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The current iteration is like "data engineering as a service for
                books." A book is a powerful thing. I'm hoping to give a
                bookstore everything they need to sell books online. Inventory,
                e-commerce, marketing, etc. It's a crowded market but I've had
                fun making the bookselling app that I believe should exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you know any booksellers, please let them know about this!
                I'm onboarding my first customer right now and the biggest
                bottleneck is the other bookselling software providers, despite
                my intention to collaborate instead of compete. It's frustrating
                to wait for two weeks for a point of sale provider to setup an
                integration. It's almost like they don't care about their
                customers. Some providers even require ethernet cables for their
                software...still partying like it's 1999. Perfect for
                early-adopter booksellers frustrated with current tech who
                understand the power of automation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently looking for funding so I can focus on this
                full-time. My biggest problem right now is time (aka money)
                because I have to sell my time to make rent etc, and can't focus
                on this project like I need to. I've gotten good validation from
                booksellers and other technically savvy folks in the industry
                (I've heard from two different companies that they've considered
                building something like this), so I believe I have something
                valuable. I'm not interested in funding from somebody who
                doesn't share my love for books or doesn't support my mission:
                help people use technology to promote literature. I believe that
                literature is one of humanity’s most prized creations, and we
                can use technology as a tool to keep this gift alive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please email me at sam@bookhead.net if you know of booksellers
                who might want to be an early adopter, or know of any funding
                opportunities that might be a good fit.
