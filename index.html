              <p>
                Hope everyone is well. This app was borne out of my own
                frustration. I thought that I was terrible at learning languages
                at school, since I didn't become conversational in French after
                5 years of study. However, I later traveled with some French
                friends and, in just under 3 weeks, I was able to hold a
                reasonable conversation. I realized that there's no substitute
                for speaking to native speakers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I tried to adopt this approach for other languages, but it's
                much harder to find people to practise with when you aren't
                travelling. I started using iTalki to meet people from different
                countries and chat to them. It quickly became very expensive and
                time-consuming to schedule the calls, so I gave up.
              </p>
              <p>
                I made PrettyPolly so that anyone can easily practice speaking
                26 languages orally. The app uses ChatGPT (amongst other tools)
                to allow you to practice speaking whenever you want. It also
                generates a fluency score for each conversation so that you have
                an objective way of tracking progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's free to use (up to 15 conversations per month). I've found
                that using it once or twice per day is plenty, and you'll be
                amazed at how much you will pick up in a week. I've added some
                FAQs here in case useful -

              >), a marketplace that lets you shop for doctors and compare your
              out-of-pocket costs upfront (currently only in NYC). Using each
              patient's insurance and machine learning, we predict and guarantee
              out-of-pocket costs to prevent surprise bills.
              <p>
                We grew up in immigrant families, and for both of us, our
                parents would honestly tell us to not trust doctors because of
                unexpected medical bills. They really believed that doctors were
                adding on unnecessary things that didn’t help in order to make
                more money. As adults, we’ve both had first-hand experiences
                receiving surprise bills even with good insurance while working
                at tech companies, so solving this problem is personal to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out 38% of Americans delay medical care for fear of the
                bill while prices vary 2-10x across health providers, even when
                using insurance. This led us to believe that creating a
                marketplace with transparent out-of-pocket costs could be a
                solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it wasn’t until the July 2022 Transparency in Coverage
                Rule (<a
                  href="https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency"
                  >https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency</a
                >) that we had the payer pricing data (that’s actually high
                quality compared to hospital data) to create this marketplace.
                Certainly is the first company to use this data to predict and
                guarantee prices for consumers to book doctors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know the HN community has been interested in applications of
                healthcare price transparency data (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32738783"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32738783</a
                >), so we’re excited to share how we’re using this data to
                predict and guarantee prices for a consumer application.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Certainly, patients can enter their insurance, compare
                guaranteed out-of-pocket costs across doctors, and book an
                appointment with price transparency. For providers, we guarantee
                any patient we send them will always pay. Partner providers pay
                us any time we send them a new patient. Eventually, we’ll
                convert providers to using our SaaS platform to guarantee
                payments from existing patients.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are currently focused on shoppable services - anything that
                can be scheduled in advance. Our solution falls between two ends
                of the spectrum for consumer shopping experiences. At one end is
                healthcare, where the status quo is you go to a doctor and you
                have no idea what will happen and you have no idea how much it
                will cost. At the other end is going to a restaurant, having a
                menu of items with corresponding prices, and deciding which
                items you want to order.
              </p>
              <p>
                Certainly Health lets you see what services could happen during
                your visit and how much they will cost. We guarantee that if
                those services happen, you will not pay more than the
                out-of-pocket costs you saw upfront for each of those services.
                But it is ultimately the doctor who decides which services you
                end up getting (like a chef deciding which dishes you will be
                served). As a result, you can compare upfront out-of-pocket
                costs specific to your insurance and book a provider without
                worrying about surprise bills.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common misconception is that patient out-of-pocket costs are
                set by doctors. Prices of healthcare services are actually the
                result of negotiations between providers and insurance
                companies. Groups with more negotiating power, like large
                hospital systems, are able to command higher rates than private
                practice physicians. This variance in cost is enormous across
                almost all procedures we've looked at, even between providers a
                few blocks from each other. It might cost $105 to get an
                orthopedic consultation with one doctor, and $550 to get a
                consultation with another doctor across the street, for example.
                This price variance means the out-of-pocket cost also varies for
                patients with high deductible plans or plans where the copay
                does not cover all services (which we’ve encountered very
                often).
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not use hospital price data which is inconsistent and
                messy (<a
                  href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/analysis-inconsistencies-within-hospital-price-transparency-data-make-cost-comparisons-difficult/"
                  >https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/analysis-inco...</a
                >). Instead, our guaranteed prices are based on three things:
                (1) health insurance published rates for procedures, as required
                by regulation; (2) patient eligibility/benefits information
                (e.g. deductible, copay, coinsurance); and (3) an online
                learning model to account for variance across thousands of plans
                and patient conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we process payments and claims, we create an accurate
                platform for predicting out-of-pocket costs by accounting for
                variations such as whether certain procedures are covered by an
                insurance plan/copay, and how the rate changes based on
                diagnosis code (we discovered V97.33XD is for "Sucked into jet
                engine, subsequent encounter”), number of units, medical coding
                modifiers, and other factors.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Although we’re early, we’re starting to see intended results.
                One patient saved $850 on a podiatrist visit booked through us
                compared to a previous visit with a different doctor for the
                exact same services. Another was charged for an annual physical,
                but we identified the mistake and got a refund issued to him.
                Most of our customers have had surprise bills in the past and
                are happy to have peace of mind with our upfront, guaranteed
                prices.

              <p>## Long Version: Best of three worlds</p>
              <p>
                Hi, I'm Rasso Hilber. I have been a web designer and developer
                since around 2004. From the beginning of my career, I always had
                to make tradeoffs between 3 goals when building websites:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. The websites I build should be visually impressive, original,
                and snappy.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. The websites I build should be crawlable, accessible and
                standards compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. The websites I build should have low technical complexity and
                be easy to maintain in the long run.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the beginning, I was able to achieve goals 1 (impressive!)
                and 3 (easy to maintain!) by using Macromedia/Adobe Flash, but
                due to the nature of the technology horribly failed to deliver
                crawlable and accessible websites. Later, I found a way to run
                two sites in parallel for each website I built, one using
                CMS-generated XHTML for crawlability, one in Flash for the
                visitors, fetching the data from its XHTML twin. Now I had
                solved goals 1 and 2, but my setup was awfully complex and
                brittle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Around 2010, I was relieved to see Flash finally coming to its
                end. I switched to building websites using PHP, HTML, and
                jQuery. I could now tick goals 2 (accessibility) and 3 (low
                complexity), but the websites I was able to build using these
                technologies weren't as impressive anymore. Hard page loads
                between every link click being one of the biggest regressions in
                UX from the days of Flash IMO.
              </p>
              <p>
                Around 2014/15, I first heard about the new frameworks: Angular,
                React, Vue. These frameworks were not intended to be used for
                classic websites. They were made for single-page-apps! But it
                felt to me like no one cared. Even when building classic
                websites, many developers sacrificed SEO and accessibility for a
                snappy experience, serving an empty `&lt;div
                id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` to the browser. I couldn't blame them;
                I had done the same in my early days as a Flash developer. They
                ticked goal 1 (impressive) and goal 3 (low complexity). But the
                lack of accessibility kept me from joining the movement. I was
                still building classic websites, after all.
              </p>
              <p>
                After some time, many started realizing that serving an empty
                div had downsides – SSR, hydration, and whatnot were born, now
                ticking goal 1 (impressive) and goal 2 (accessibility), with the
                trade-off of awful complexity. It reminded me a lot of my little
                Frankenstein's monster "Flash+XHTML," and I still didn't want to
                join the hype.
              </p>
              <p>
                Still, because the noise was so loud, I felt like I might be
                becoming obsolete, an "old man yelling at the clouds".
              </p>
              <p>
                New very interesting tools like HTMX or Unpoly popped up that
                looked promising at first, but at closer inspection weren't
                optimized for my use case either. These were primarily built for
                real interfaces/single-page-apps (html snippets instead of full
                pages, UI state independent of URLs, altered DOM saved in
                history snapshots, ...). I wanted to find a <i>tiny</i> tool,
                optimized for building <i>presentational</i>,
                <i>content-driven</i> websites with a strong focus on
                <i>accessibility</i>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, after a few years of rolling my own home-grown
                solutions, I started using swup[0], a "Versatile and extensible
                page transition library for server-rendered websites". Swup
                consists of a tiny core and a rich ecosystem of official
                plugins[1] for additional functionality. It was hitting the
                sweet spot between simplicity and complexity, and felt like it
                was perfect for my use cases. Shortly after I had started using
                it, I became a core contributor and maintainer of swup.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only thing I was still missing to be a happy developer was
                the ability to create really complex navigation paths where
                selected fragments are updated as you navigate a site, much like
                nested routes allow in React or Vue.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last two months I teamed up with @daun [2] to finally solve
                this hard problem. The result is two things:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. A new major release of swup (v4) that allows customizing the
                complete page transition process by providing a powerful hook
                system and a mutable visit object 2. The newly released
                fragment-plugin [3] that provides a declarative API for
                dynamically replacing containers based on rules
              </p>
              <p>Use cases for the fragment-plugin are:</p>
              <p>
                - a filter UI that live-updates its list of results on every
                interaction
              </p>
              <p>
                - a detail overlay that shows on top of the currently open
                content
              </p>
              <p>
                - a tab group that updates only itself when selecting one of the
                tabs
              </p>
              <p>- a form that updates only itself upon submission</p>
              <p>I can now finally build websites that tick all three boxes:</p>
              <p>
                1. Visually impressive, fun, and snappy by using swup's
                first-class support for animations[4], cache[5], and preload
                capacities[6], enhanced with fragment visits as seen on the demo
                site.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Accessible by being able to serve server-rendered semantic
                markup that will fully work even with JavaScript disabled (try
                it out on the demo site!). On top of that, swup's a11y plugin[7]
                will automatically announce page visits to assistive
                technologies and will focus the new `&lt;main&gt;` element after
                each visit.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Because now all I need for my fancy frontend is a bit of
                progressive JavaScript, I can choose whatever tool I like on the
                server, keeping complexity low and maintainability high. I can
                use SSGs like eleventy or Astro (the demo site is built using
                Astro!), I can use any CMS like WordPress or ProcessWire, or a
                framework like Laravel. And I don't have to maintain an
                additional node server for SSG!
              </p>
              <p>
                The plugin is still in it's early stages, but I have a good
                feeling that this finally is the right path for me as a web
                developer. All it took was 20 years! ;)
              </p>
