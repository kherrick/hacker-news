              <p>
                If you’ve been to doctors in the US, you may have encountered
                the problem: how does a healthcare provider get access to your
                up-to-date medical history to treat you properly? Reliance on
                archaic methods is still the norm: typically you, or your
                provider, need to call the facilities where you’ve previously
                received treatment (assuming you remember them all), just to
                have them send your records via fax (yep, fax). This can take
                weeks, only then to have a provider sift through hundreds of
                pages of unstructured docs, just to figure out basic things like
                your active medication list, what conditions you may have,
                latest lab results, etc. This not only delays treatment, it can
                cause improper treatment, since the medical history is critical
                for treatment decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, here’s a crazy story from a customer of ours:
                recently a patient came to them asking for a specific
                medication. When the provider pulled their medical history
                through Metriport, they saw that the patient had had a heart
                attack in the last 6 months. (The patient had omitted to mention
                this.) In such a case, the medication they were asking for could
                cause death! Needless to say, the provider did not fulfill that
                request—but they did begin to look for medications that could
                actually work for that patient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many providers use Electronic Health Record (EHR) software to
                manage their patients’ data, but many EHRs don’t talk to each
                other, which means a patient’s data is more often than not
                siloed across disparate systems with incompatible data formats.
                More recently, Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) emerged to
                make the exchange of patient medical data possible between
                different providers. HIEs are essentially a peer-to-peer network
                for clinical data exchange. These networks helped push
                interoperability in the right direction, but their underlying
                technology is still based on older tech from the 90s, requiring
                SOAP-based protocols for transactions, using mostly C-CDAs (XML
                files), PDFs, and images to exchange medical data. A patient
                with a chronic condition may have thousands of such files across
                dozens of providers, and they all contain messy, likely
                unstructured, and duplicate information. Even if you spend lots
                of dev time, and money, connecting to all of these exchanges
                (like we did), you’re still left with the tough problem of
                making this medical data actually usable for providers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We did YC in S22, starting with a quantified self personal
                health app (this was our Show HN:
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29800932"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29800932</a
                >
                - it didn’t get very far!). Working on clinical use cases for
                the app ran us straight into this insane rats’ nest of
                30-year-old technologies, all incompatible with each other, just
                to integrate medical data into our product. Vendors attempting
                to solve this problem wanted to lock us into $100k+ yearly
                contracts without even letting us try their closed-source
                product! Integration time would have been months, and developer
                docs were a whole new order of jank. It took us a while to
                realize there really was no good solution to this—it was hard to
                believe—but then we started talking to other healthcare
                companies and found they had the same problem. At that point it
                was a no-brainer to pivot to this instead. We kept the name
                Metriport though :).
              </p>
              <p>
                Metriport connects to all 3 major HIE networks (CommonWell,
                Carequality, and eHealth Exchange), and provides an API and
                dashboard. Here’s how it works: (1) You input basic patient
                demographics (name, DOB, gender at birth, address); (2) we
                search through hundreds of thousands of providers across
                multiple HIEs for the patient’s records; (3) Once the records
                are found, we fetch all of them and convert them into usable
                JSON data - standardized to FHIR; (4) The data, and raw files,
                are made available on the API and dashboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can render the data in a way that’s immediately useful for
                providers, like deduplicated PDF medical record summaries. From
                there, you can also use Metriport to contribute new clinical
                patient information back to the providers in the network,
                regardless of what EHR they use—eliminating the need for many
                painful one-off EHR integrations. It’s a little known fact that
                you can do this using HIEs without needing to write individual
                integrations to EHRs like Epic, Athena, and Cerner, for example.
              </p>
              <p>
                The value of this approach is that healthtech companies and
                providers don’t have to go build dozens of EHR integrations
                themselves, or have to know where patient data is located, and
                can instead tap into a single “internet of healthcare data”.
                Going from entering inputs to getting a comprehensive medical
                record summary is done in 3 minutes on average. Compare that to
                weeks using fax machines just to get messy data!
              </p>
              <p>
                You may be wondering how the search for records is done, using
                only patient demographics. Essentially, these networks consist
                of a bunch of nodes talking to each other asking “hey, do you
                have records for John Doe?”. So, this boils down to sending HTTP
                requests containing the patient’s demographics to a bunch of
                endpoints, and the endpoints returning the ID representing the
                patient in their system if there’s a match. You’ll be surprised
                (or at least dismayed) to hear that there is no standardization
                for how patient matching is determined across systems in the
                networks, which is problematic with something as highly variable
                as a person’s demographics. This means if one system wants to
                consider a single typo in the patient’s first name a mismatch,
                they can go ahead and do so—making it difficult for others to
                find records in their system. This problem is so pervasive that
                one of the national HIEs started an initiative to get other
                network participants to share their patient matching algorithm
                to help improve response rates for all systems in the network.
                Sadly, only one vendor agreed to share their matching algorithm.
                To combat this status quo, we’ve open-sourced our patient
                matching algorithm, which uses a variant of the Fellegi-Sunter
                model, and we hope other vendors will follow suit in the future:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/metriport/metriport/blob/3e82111bc081a39a228276f2bf9d041d9a8df60e/packages/core/src/mpi/patient-mpi-metriport-api.ts#L13-L38"

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Another big part of this is the data mapping from one format to
                another. If you’re not familiar with healthcare data, FHIR is
                the latest and greatest standard that’s ubiquitous in modern
                systems. In Metriport, FHIR is represented with JSON. The older
                standard is HL7v3 (C-CDA), which is what all healthcare
                information exchanges still use today, and what EHRs typically
                export - C-CDAs are messy XML documents that have structure, but
                also contain a lot of unstructured data in HTML format, or free
                text. So you can imagine, the ability to convert C-CDA medical
                records to something actually usable like FHIR, is pretty
                important. Given that it’s important, you’d also think it’s a
                fairly solved problem, with plenty of resources/tools to wrangle
                the data… nope. Again, there are little to no standards here,
                and you have different vendors building proprietary systems
                in-house, attempting to solve the same problem, with mediocre
                black-box results that you can’t trust. We see making healthcare
                data usable more like a public body of knowledge that can be
                improved upon, and don’t think this work should be closed off to
                the world, so we also open-sourced our FHIR converter (<a
                  href="https://github.com/metriport/metriport/tree/develop/packages/fhir-converter"
                  >https://github.com/metriport/metriport/tree/develop/packages...</a
                >), and you can give it a spin here:
                <a
                  href="https://docs.metriport.com/converter-api/getting-started/quickstart"
                  >https://docs.metriport.com/converter-api/getting-started/qui...</a
                >. In the future, we will also leverage things like OCR on PDFs
                to do clinical data extraction, and use LLMs to make even more
                concise medical record summaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Making Metriport open-source was a decision we made from day
                one, based on our philosophy that transparency leads to
                innovation, especially in healthcare.
              </p>
              <p>
                From a security and compliance standpoint, we’re fully SOC 2
                Type 2 and HIPAA compliant (<a
                  href="https://security.metriport.com/"
                  >https://security.metriport.com/</a
                >). Additionally, using Metriport for patient data exchange
                today requires a Treatment purpose of use under HIPAA - which
                means that only Covered Entities, or Business Associates who
                work with Covered Entities, can use Metriport. This means that
                companies doing things such as clinical trials recruitment, for
                example, can’t use Metriport, but a primary care provider, or a
                clinical decision support vendor, can. This is due to current
                requirements set forth by HIEs, which may open up to support
                alternative use cases in the future, such as Individual Access
                Services (IAS).
              </p>
              <p>
                We charge per full medical record retrieval for a patient (which
                we call a query). This starts at $1 per query (with a monthly
                minimum), and scales down from there based on volume. We only
                charge for queries that return at least one record (and even if
                a query returns 1000 documents for a single patient, we still
                count that as a single query) - no charge is incurred for
                sharing data back to the networks, or making API calls to
                generate medical record summaries, for example.
              </p>

                >https://www.github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync</a
              >). Neosync is an open source platform that helps developers
              anonymize production data, generate synthetic data and sync it
              across their environments for better testing, debugging and
              developer experience.
              <p>
                Most developers and teams have some version of a database seed
                script that creates some mock data for their local and stage
                databases. The problem is that production data is messy and it’s
                very difficult to replicate that with mock data. This causes two
                big problems for developers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first problem is that features seem to work locally/stage
                but have bugs and edge cases in production because the seed data
                you used to develop against was not representative of production
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second problem we saw was that debugging production errors
                would take a long time and would often resurface. When we see a
                bug in production, the first thing we want to do is reproduce it
                locally, but if we can’t reproduce the state of the data
                locally, then we’re kind of flying blind.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working directly with production data would solve both of these
                problems but most teams can’t because of: (1) privacy/security
                issues and (2) scale. So we set out to solve these two problems
                with Neosync.
              </p>
              <p>
                We solve the privacy and security problem using anonymization
                and synthetic data. We have 40+ pre-built transformers (or you
                can write your own in code) that can anonymize PII or sensitive
                data so that it’s safe to use locally. Additionally, you can
                generate synthetic data from scratch that fits your existing
                schema across your database.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second problem is scale. Some production databases are too
                big to fit locally or just have more data than you need. Also,
                in some cases, you may want to debug a certain customer’s data
                and you only want their data. We solve this with subsetting. You
                can pass in a SQL query to filter your table(s) and Neosync will
                handle all of the heavy lifting including referential integrity.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the core of Neosync does three things: (1) It streams data
                from a source to one or multiple destination databases. We never
                store your sensitive data. (2) While that data is being
                streamed, we transform it. You define which schemas and tables
                you want to sync and at the column level, select a transformer
                that defines how you want to anonymize the data or generate
                synthetic data. (3) We subset your data based on your filters.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do all of this while handling referential integrity. Whether
                you have primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints,
                circular dependencies (within a table and across tables),
                sequences and more, Neosync preserves those references.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also ship with APIs, a Terraform provider, a CLI and Github
                action that you can use to hydrate a CI database.

                Best results when training a custom router on your own prompt
                data:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9JYqNbIEac0"
                  >https://youtu.be/9JYqNbIEac0</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The router balances user preferences for quality, speed and
                cost. The end result is higher quality and faster LLM responses
                at lower cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                The quality for each candidate LLM is predicted ahead of time
                using a neural scoring function, which is a BERT-like
                architecture conditioned on the prompt and a latent
                representation of the LLM being scored. The different LLMs are
                queried across the batch dimension, with the neural scoring
                architecture taking a single latent representation of the LLM as
                input per forward pass. This makes the scoring function very
                modular to query for different LLM combinations. It is trained
                in a supervised manner on several open LLM datasets, using GPT4
                as a judge. The cost and speed data is taken from our live
                benchmarks, updated every few hours across all continents. The
                final "loss function" is a linear combination of quality, cost,
                inter-token-latency and time-to-first-token, with the user
                effectively scaling the weighting factors of this linear
                combination.
              </p>
              <p>
                Smaller LLMs are often good enough for simple prompts, but
                knowing exactly how and when they might break is difficult.
                Simple perturbations of the phrasing can cause smaller LLMs to
                fail catastrophically, making them hard to rely on. For example,
                Gemma-7B converts numbers to strings and returns the "largest"
                string when asking for the "largest" number in a set, but works
                fine when asking for the "highest" or "maximum".
              </p>
              <p>
                The router is able to learn these quirky distributions, and
                ensure that the smaller, cheaper and faster LLMs are only used
                when there is high confidence that they will get the answer
                correct.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pricing-wise, we charge the same rates as the backend providers
                we route to, without taking any margins. We also give $50 in
                free credits to all new signups.
              </p>
              <p>
                The router can be used off-the-shelf, or it can be trained
                directly on your own data for improved performance.
              </p>
