            <div class="text">
              I am working on a trademark and some IP that I started way back in
              2020 for my own AI and looks like I made the right choice
              considering the paywalls and having to pay for API access and what
              not. So my question to Hackernews is what are things that you
              think we should focus on for the future? I really liked the
              /r/selfhosted project that someone made to diagnose their own
              medical issues and what not so that is great. But what are some
              fields and other important things to focus on. I am from Canada by
              the way sadly. It seems like I will have a really good shot at
              releasing meta made in canada games and I think they would get a
              lot of traction. But not too interested in making games, very
              interested in building tooling for game developers to make their
              life easier though and I have been using deep research to compile
              some interesting information that I would like to compile and
              build something for my fellow gamedevs that want to build stuff
              for le Steamdeck. But anyway, what are some markets that we need
              to be on the lookout for in NA? I am interested in social
              networks, especially with whatever DDOS thing that Twitter/X is
              having right now and I did make a previous post asking how we can
              build our own social network and it seems like right now a good
              topic of discussion would also be how to make ddos resistant
              social networks. I remember studying this a bit when I was
              building my own manga readerr when mangadex initially went down
              and I had an approach wtih Rust (for any of you that reads manga
              from onemanga or batoto and thsoe days and even mangadex days
              knows how slow it was to read manga and how easy it was for people
              to ddos the shit out of it) - anyway this is suppose to be a fun
              discussion.

                I've been working on canvas language for 15 years now. Not very
                successful, but editable gifs turned out okay. Since it's my
                passion, I keep trying, and my latest is editable games - I'm
                not officially calling it that though.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've had some interest in advergames and this would allow
                designers to easily customize games for their clients - the
                hidden objects game being the best example for this, and the
                only one made specifically for the purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyways, games are interpreted at runtime by JavaScript. To
                publish, for example on itch or your own website, you need to
                submit your project file (download it from the dev studio) and
                wait a few minutes. You'll get back a JS file that contains your
                game.
              </p>
              <p>
                ngl, although a passion project, I'd like this to one day be
                profitable - trying to work that out.
              </p>
              <p>
                If interested, the main project site is
                <a href="https://canvaslanguage.com"
                  >https://canvaslanguage.com</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd love to get some feedback. Although to be honest, I just
                want to show somebody my newest creation :)
              </p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

                We will soon also be releasing a vector index as part of Kuzu
                that you can also use in the browser to build traditional RAG or
                Graph RAG that retrieves from both vectors and graphs. The
                system has come a long way since we open sourced it about 2
                years ago, so please give us feedback about how it can be more
                useful!
