                >https://www.parachute-ai.com/</a
              >). We’re building governance infrastructure that lets hospitals
              safely evaluate and monitor clinical AI at scale.
              <p>
                Hospitals are racing to adopt AI. More than 2,000 clinical AI
                tools hit the U.S. market last year - from ambient scribes to
                imaging models. But new regulations (HTI-1, Colorado AI Act,
                California SB 3030, White House AI Action Plan) require
                auditable proof that these models are safe, fair, and
                continuously monitored.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem is, most hospital IT teams can’t keep up. They can’t
                vet every vendor, run stress tests, and monitor models 24/7. As
                a result, promising tools die in pilot hell while risk exposure
                grows.
              </p>
              <p>
                We saw this firsthand while deploying AI at Columbia University
                Irving Medical Center, so we built Parachute. Columbia is now
                using it to track live AI models in production.
              </p>
              <p>
                How it works: First, Parachute evaluates vendors against a
                hospital’s clinical needs and flags compliance and security
                risks before a pilot even begins. Next, we run automated
                benchmarking and red-teaming to stress test each model and
                uncover risks like hallucinations, bias, or safety gaps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a model is deployed, Parachute continuously monitors its
                accuracy, drift, bias, and uptime, sending alerts the moment
                thresholds are breached. Finally, every approval, test, and
                runtime change is sealed into an immutable audit trail that
                hospitals can hand directly to regulators and auditors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love to hear from anyone with hospital experience who has
                an interest in deploying AI safely. We look forward to your
                comments!

              <a href="https://upliftai.org">https://upliftai.org</a>). We build
              models that speak underserved languages — today: Urdu, Sindhi, and
              Balochi.
              <p>
                A billion people worldwide can't read. In countries like
                Pakistan – the 5th most populous country – 42% of adults are
                illiterate. This holds back the entire economy: patients can't
                read medical reports, parents can't help with homework, banks
                can't go fully digital, farmers can't research best practices,
                and people memorize smartphone app button sequences. Voice AI
                interfaces can fix all of this, and we think this will perhaps
                be one of the great benefits of modern AI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, existing voice models barely work for these
                languages, and big tech is moving slowly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uplift AI was originally a side project to make datasets for
                translation and voice models. For us it was a "cool side-thing"
                to work on, not an "important full-time thing" to work on. With
                some initial data we hacked together a Urdu Voice Bot on
                Whatsapp and gave it to one domestic worker. In two days 800
                people were using it. When we dived deeper into understanding
                the users, we learned that text interfaces don't work for sooo
                many. So we started Uplift AI to solve this problem fulltime.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most challenging part is that all the building blocks needed
                for great voice models are broken for these languages. For
                example, if you are creating a speech synthesis model, you will
                scrape a lot of data from youtube and auto-label it using a
                transcription model… all very easy to do in English. But it
                doesn't work in under-served languages because the transcription
                modes are not accurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are many other challenges. Like when you hire human
                transcribers to label the data, often they don't have any spell
                correctors for their languages, and this creates lots of noise
                in the data… making it hard to train models with low data. There
                are many more challenges in phonemes, silence detection,
                diacritization etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                We solve these problems by making great internal tooling to help
                with data labeling. Also, we source our own data and don't buy
                it. This is counterintuitive, but a big advantage over companies
                buying data and then training. By sourcing our own data we
                create the right data distributions and get much better models
                with much less data. By doing the entire thing inhouse, (data,
                labeling, training, deploying) we are able to make a lot faster
                progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today we publicly offer a text to speech APIs for Urdu, Sindhi,
                and Balochi. Here's a video which shows this:
                <a
                  href="https://www.loom.com/share/dcd5020967444c228e9c127151e7a9f5"
                  >https://www.loom.com/share/dcd5020967444c228e9c127151e7a9f5</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Khan Academy is using our tech to dub videos to Urdu (<a
                  href="https://ur.khanacademy.org"
                  >https://ur.khanacademy.org</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Our models excel at informational use cases (like AI bots) but
                need more work in emotive use-cases like poetry.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have been giving a lot of people private access in beta mode,
                and today are launching our models publicly. We believe this
                will be the fastest way for us to learn about areas that are not
                performing well so we can fix them quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'd love to hear from all of you, especially around your
                experiences with under-served languages (not just the Pakistani
                ones we're starting with) and your comments in general.

              <p>
                In December of 2022, I was scrolling Twitter in the wee-hours of
                the morning holding my then-newborn daughter. ChatGPT had
                launched, and we were all figuring out what this technology was
                and how to make it useful. Developers were using retrieval to
                bring their data to the models - and so I DM’d every person who
                had tweeted about “embeddings” in the entire month of December.
                (it was only 120 people!) I saw then how AI was going to need to
                search to all the world’s information to build useful and
                reliable applications.
              </p>
              <p>Anton Troynikov and I started Chroma with the beliefs that:</p>
              <p>1. AI-based systems were way too difficult to productionize</p>
              <p>
                2. Latent space was incredibly important to improving AI-based
                systems (no one understood this at the time)
              </p>
              <p>
                On Valentines Day 2023, we launched first version of Chroma and
                it immediately took off. Chroma made retrieval just work. Chroma
                is now a large open-source project with 21k+ stars and 5M
                monthly downloads, used at companies like Apple, Amazon,
                Salesforce, and Microsoft.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today we’re excited to launch Chroma Cloud - our fully-managed
                offering backed by an Apache 2.0 serverless database called
                Chroma Distributed. Chroma Distributed is written in Rust and
                uses object-storage for extreme scalability and reliability.
                Chroma Cloud is fast and cheap. Leading AI companies such as
                Factory, Weights &amp; Biases, Propel, and Foam already use
                Chroma Cloud in production to power their agents. It brings the
                “it just works” developer experience developers have come to
                know Chroma for - to the Cloud.
              </p>
              <p>Try it out and let me know what you think!</p>

              <p>
                I really like dictation. For years, I relied on transcription
                tools that were <i>almost</i> good, but they were all
                closed-source. Even a lot of them that claimed to be “local” or
                “on-device” were still black boxes that left me wondering where
                my audio really went.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I built Whispering. It’s open-source, local-first, and most
                importantly, transparent with your data. Your data is stored
                locally on your device, and your audio goes directly from your
                machine to a local provider (Whisper C++, Speaches, etc.) or
                your chosen cloud provider (Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.). For
                me, the features were good enough that I left my paid tools
                behind (I used Superwhisper and Wispr Flow before).
              </p>
              <p>
                Productivity apps should be open-source and transparent with
                your data, but they also need to match the UX of paid,
                closed-software alternatives. I hope Whispering is near that
                point. I use it for several hours a day, from coding to thinking
                out loud while carrying pizza boxes back from the office.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s an overview:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jYgBMrfVZs"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jYgBMrfVZs</a
                >, and here’s how I personally am using it with Claude Code
                these days:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpix588SeiQ"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpix588SeiQ</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are plenty of transcription apps out there, but I hope
                Whispering adds some extra competition from the OSS ecosystem
                (one of my other OSS favorites is Handy
                <a href="https://github.com/cjpais/Handy"
                  >https://github.com/cjpais/Handy</a
                >). Whispering has a few tricks up its sleeve, like a
                voice-activated mode for hands-free operation (no button
                holding), and customizable AI transformations with any
                prompt/model.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whispering used to be in my personal GH repo, but I recently
                moved it as part of a larger project called Epicenter (<a
                  href="https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter"
                  >https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter</a
                >), which I should explain a bit...
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m basically obsessed with local-first open-source software. I
                think there should be an open-source, local-first version of
                every app, and I would like them all to work together. The idea
                of Epicenter is to store your data in a folder of plaintext and
                SQLite, and build a suite of interoperable, local-first tools on
                top of this shared memory. Everything is totally transparent, so
                you can trust it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whispering is the first app in this effort. It’s not there yet
                regarding memory, but it’s getting there. I’ll probably write
                more about the bigger picture soon, but mainly I just want to
                make software and let it speak for itself (no pun intended in
                this case!), so this is my Show HN for now.
              </p>
              <p>
                I just finished college and was about to move back with my
                parents and work on this instead of getting a job…and then I
                somehow got into YC. So my current plan is to cover my living
                expenses and use the YC funding to support maintainers, our
                dependencies, and people working on their own open-source
                local-first projects. More on that soon.
              </p>
