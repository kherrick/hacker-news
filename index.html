                Your package managers — pip, npm, docker, cargo, helm, go, all
                of them — talk directly to it using their native protocols.
                Security scanning with Trivy, Grype, and OpenSCAP is built in,
                with a policy engine that can quarantine bad artifacts before
                they hit your builds. And if you need a format it doesn't
                support yet, there's a WASM plugin system so you can add your
                own without forking the backend.
              </p>
              <p>Why I built it:</p>
              <p>
                Part of what pulled me into computers in the first place was
                open source. I grew up poor in New Orleans, and the only
                hardware I had access to in the early 2000s were some Compaq
                Pentium IIs my dad brought home after his work was tossing them
                out. I put Linux on them, and it ran circles around Windows 2000
                and Millennium on that low-end hardware. That experience taught
                me that the best software is software that's open for everyone
                to see, use, and that actually runs well on whatever you've got.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fast forward to today, and I see the same pattern everywhere:
                GitLab, JFrog, Harbor, and others ship a limited "community"
                edition and then hide the features teams actually need behind
                some paywall. I get it — paychecks have to come from somewhere.
                But I wanted to prove that a fully-featured artifact registry
                could exist as genuinely open-source software. Every feature. No
                exceptions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The specific features came from real pain points. Artifactory's
                search is painfully slow — that's why I integrated Meilisearch.
                Security scanning that doesn't require a separate enterprise
                license was another big one. And I wanted replication that
                didn't need a central coordinator — so I built a peer mesh where
                any node can replicate to any other node. I haven't deployed
                this at work yet — right now I'm running it at home for my
                personal projects — but I'd love to see it tested at scale, and
                that's a big part of why I'm sharing it here.
              </p>
              <p>The AI story (I'm going to be honest about this):</p>
              <p>
                I built this in about three weeks using Claude Code. I know a
                lot of you will say this is probably vibe coding garbage — but
                if that's the case, it's an impressive pile of vibe coding
                garbage. Go look at the codebase. The backend is ~80% Rust with
                429 unit tests, 33 PostgreSQL migrations, a layered
                architecture, and a full CI/CD pipeline with E2E tests, stress
                testing, and failure injection.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI didn't make the design decisions for me. I still had to
                design the WASM plugin system, figure out how the scanning
                engines complement each other, and architect the mesh
                replication. Years of domain knowledge drove the design — AI
                just let me build it way faster. I'm floored at what these tools
                make possible for a tinkerer and security nerd like me.
              </p>

                you'd want to see, what you hate about Artifactory or Nexus that
                you wish someone would just fix. It doesn't have to be a PR.
