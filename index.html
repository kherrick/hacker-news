                I've just released the public repository of RebootX On-Prem (<a
                  href="https://github.com/c100k/rebootx-on-prem"
                  >https://github.com/c100k/rebootx-on-prem</a
                >), letting anyone to connect and manage their infra on their
                smartphone.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my case the infra is pretty simple : 3 Raspberry Pi. But I'd
                love to have your feedback and see interesting use cases you
                could use this for.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have lots of ideas for the next steps. For example, creating a
                Prometheus integration as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking forward to hearing from you and I would be glad to help
                if you encounter any issue getting started with the repo.

                I’d love to introduce Figr Identity, which helps you generate
                design systems with variables, styles, Styles sheets and custom
                components in your design language. We built this plugin to take
                away the non-creative work from the design system setup process.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Setup the design tokens: Colours, typography, corner radius,
                spacing system, grids and elevation.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Setup the component Library: All the design tokens are
                automatically reflected in custom component library.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Export to Figma: Get the style guideline, variables, and
                component library to your file in a single click.
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love to hear your feedback as we continue to improve the
                plugin :)

              <p>
                When I was studying at MIT, I often had to wait 40-60 minutes in
                line just to get 5 minutes of “help” from a TA - when I needed
                1-2 hours. I understood that TAs can’t spend all their time
                helping me. That’s understandable. But what made me bitter was
                that, the school went the extra mile to ensure I don’t have the
                resources to learn on my own,
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Blocking access to solutions for past problems (to prevent
                cheating)
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Purposely not recording explanations to increase attendance:
                https://piazza.com/class/ky0jj3k89mz5d2/post/9
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Insisting that Office Hours is a 1-by-1 format even when
                crowded (to prevent solutions from leaking)
              </p>
              <p>
                These policies have good intentions - it’s to encourage a
                synchronous, in-person learning experience. But in practice, it
                had side-effects:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Help resources become inefficient - because so much material
                is restricted, and so much time is spent on delivering live
                lectures, there’d often be 40 students competing for help from 2
                TAs in a 2-hour Office Hours
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Because help resources are inefficient, it’s very hard to
                catch-up: once you fall behind, you have no way to review past
                material efficiently enough to compensate the difference - like
                credit card debt
              </p>
              <p>
                3.Every day, I’d wake up, go to a lecture I don’t understand, go
                to Office Hours so I can hopefully ask for a review (which’d
                would take a few hours), realize TAs aren’t willing to do that,
                then realize there is nothing I can do to recover. I fell into a
                depression for many years, and my bitterness fueled me to work
                on the early versions of explanations.app
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out that universities succeed by being prestigious, not
                by teaching well. To win at prestige, be highly selective (by
                keeping supply low), keep a huge endowment (because it affects
                school rankings), and hire the best researchers (not teachers).
                This is actually the fundamental reason for the odd incentives
                in higher education, and something felt wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
                So explanations.app is completely inspired by KhanAcademy and
                Youtube. The mystery to me was - why weren’t there more Youtube
                teachers &amp; KhanAcademy videos? I believe it’s a combination
                of:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. People who teach college subjects well often have better
                opportunities e.g. work, research
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Lack of rewards: even Youtubers with 100K views and 10K
                subscribers would have at most 1-5 paying members on Patreon
              </p>
              <p>
                On the one hand, there are all these free resources, where
                teachers changed the world way more than they ever got rewarded
                for. Then on the other hand, there is private tutoring - very
                effective - but very expensive e.g. $100/hour for college level
                subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe the balanced solution is a system where lots of
                students pay $10/week to a few teachers who make videos, like a
                paid, Q&amp;A Youtube/KhanAcademy, so it’s personalized,
                effective, but still affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are currently 2 teachers on explanations.app - Ben &amp;
                Esther - both MIT grads, teaching physics &amp; math for
                subjects like linear algebra and electromagnetism. 3 students -
                Laquazia, Lidija and Chandra from US, Serbia and Korea joined
                this month following r/physicsStudents launch:
                [https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1b2t5u6/i_started_a_program_where_mit_grads_do_physics/]
              </p>
              <p>
                While explanations.app is focused on college-level math and
                physics, the platform is completely open for anyone to learn
                and/or teach. I hope you can try it :^) and give me the chance
                to work with you.

              <a href="https://withaqua.com/">https://withaqua.com/</a>). Aqua
              is a voice-native document editor that combines reliable dictation
              and natural language commands, letting you say things like: “make
              this a list” or “it’s Erin with an E” or “add an inline citation
              here for page 86 of this book”. Here is a demo:
              <a href="https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM"
                >https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM</a
              >.
              <p>
                Finn, who is big-time dyslexic, has been using dictation
                software since the sixth grade when his dad set him up on Dragon
                Dictation. He used it through school to write papers, and has
                been keeping his own transcription benchmarks since college. All
                that time, writing with your voice has remained a cumbersome and
                brittle experience that is riddled with painpoints.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dictation software is still terrible. All the solutions
                basically compete on accuracy (i.e. speech recognition), but
                none of them deal with the fundamentally brittle nature of the
                text that they generate. They don't try to format text correctly
                and require you to learn a bunch of specialized commands, which
                often are not worth it. They're not even close to a voice
                replacement for a keyboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even post LLM, you are limited to a set of specific commands and
                the most accurate models don’t have any commands. Outside of
                these rules, the models have no sense for what is an instruction
                and what is content. You can’t say “and format this like an
                email” or “make the last bullet point shorter”. Aqua solves
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                This problem is important to Finn and millions of other people
                who would write with their voice if they could. Initially, we
                didn't think of it as a startup project. It was just something
                we wanted for ourselves. We thought maybe we'd write a novel
                with it - or something. After friends started asking to use the
                early versions of Aqua, it occurred to us that, if we didn't
                build it, maybe nobody would.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aqua Voice is a text editor that you talk to like a person.
                Depending on the way that you say it and the context in which
                you're operating, Aqua decides whether to transcribe what you
                said verbatim, execute a command, or subtly modify what you said
                into what you meant to write.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if you were to dictate: "Gryphons have classic
                forms resembling shield volcanoes," Aqua would output your text
                verbatim. But if you stumble over your words or start a sentence
                over a few times, Aqua is smart enough to figure that out and to
                only take the last version of the sentence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vision is not only to provide a more natural dictation
                experience, but to enable for the first time an AI-writing
                experience that feels natural and collaborative. This requires
                moving away from using LLMs for one-off chat requests and
                towards something that is more like streaming where you are in
                constant contact with the model. Voice is the natural medium for
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aqua is actually 6 models working together to transcribe,
                interpret, and rewrite the document according to your intent.
                Technically, executing a real-time voice application with a
                language model at its core requires complex coordination between
                multiple pieces. We use MoE transcription to outperform what was
                previously thought possible in terms of real-time accuracy. Then
                we sync up with a language model to determine what should be on
                the screen as quickly as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The model isn't perfect, but it is ready for early adopters and
                we’ve already been getting feedback from grateful users. For
                example, a historian with carpal tunnel sent us an email he
                wrote using Aqua and said that he is now able to be five times
                as productive as he was previously. We've heard from other
                people with disabilities that prevent them from typing. We've
                also seen good adoption from people who are dyslexic or simply
                prefer talking to typing. It’s being used for everything from
                emails to brainstorming to papers to legal briefings.
              </p>
              <p>
                While there is much left to do in terms of latency and
                robustness, the best experiences with Aqua are beginning to feel
                magical. We would love for you to try it out and give us
                feedback, which you can do with no account on
                <a href="https://withaqua.com">https://withaqua.com</a>. If you
                find it useful, it’s $10/month after a 1000-token free trial.
                (We want to bump the free trial in the future, but we're a small
                team, and running this thing isn’t cheap.)
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love to hear your ideas and comments with voice-to-text!
