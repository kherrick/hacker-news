              <a href="https://www.credal.ai/">https://www.credal.ai/</a>). We
              provide a Chat UI and APIs that enforce PII redaction, audit
              logging, and data access controls for companies that want to use
              LLMs with their corporate data from Google Docs, Slack, or
              Confluence. There’s a demo video here:
              <a
                href="https://www.loom.com/share/2b5409fd64464dc9b5b6277f2be4e90f?sid=7a728d97-58ac-4355-9c87-75eaf12b0775"
                >https://www.loom.com/share/2b5409fd64464dc9b5b6277f2be4e90f?...</a
              >.
              <p>
                One big thing enterprises and businesses are worried about with
                LLMs is “what’s happening to my data”? The way we see it, there
                are three big security and privacy barriers companies need to
                solve:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Controlling what data goes to whom: the basic stuff is just
                putting controls in place around customer and employee PII, but
                it can get trickier when you also want to be putting controls in
                place around business secrets, so companies can ensure the Coca
                Cola recipe doesn’t accidentally leave the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Visibility: Enterprise IT wants to know exactly what data was
                shared by whom, when, at what time, and what the model responded
                with (not to mention how much the request cost!). Each provider
                gives you a piece of the puzzle in their dashboard, but getting
                all this visibility per request from either of the main
                providers currently requires writing code yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Access Controls: Enterprises have lots of documents that for
                whatever reason cannot be shared internally to everyone. So how
                do I make sure employees can use AI with this stuff, without
                compromising the sensitivity of the data?
              </p>
              <p>
                Typically this pain is something that is felt most acutely by
                Enterprise IT, but also of course by the developers and business
                people who get told not to build the great stuff they can
                envision. We think it’s critical to solve these issues since the
                more visibility and control we can give Enterprise IT about how
                data is used, the more we can actually build on top of these
                APIs and start applying some of the awesome capabilities of the
                foundation models across every business problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can easily grab data from sources like Google Docs via their
                APIs, but for production use cases, you have to respect the
                permissions on each Google Doc, Confluence Page, Slack channel
                etc. This gets tricky when these systems combine some
                permissions defined totally inside their product, with
                permissions that are inherited from the company’s SSO provider
                (often Okta or Azure AD). Respecting all these permissions
                becomes both hard and vital as the number of employees and tools
                accessing the data grows.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current state of the art is to use a vector database like
                Pinecone, Milvus, or Chroma, integrate your internal data with
                those systems, and then when a user asks a question, dynamically
                figure out which bits are relevant to the user’s question and
                send those to the AI as part of the prompt. We handle all this
                automatically for you (using Milvus for now, which we host
                ourselves), including the point and click connectors for your
                data (Google Docs/Sheets, Slack, Confluence with many more
                coming soon). You can use that data through our UI already and
                we’re in the process of adding this search functionality to the
                API as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                There’s other schlep work that devs would rather not worry
                about: building out request level audit logs, staying on top of
                the rapidly changing API formats from these providers,
                implementing failover for when these heavily overburdened APIs
                go down etc, We think individual devs should not have to do
                these themselves, but the foundation model providers are
                unlikely to provide consistent, customer centric approaches for
                them. The PII detection piece in some ways is the easiest -
                there are a lot of good open source models for doing this, and
                companies using Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock seem less concerned
                with it anyway. We expect that the emphasis companies place on
                the redactions we provide may actually go down over time, while
                the emphasis on unified, consistent audit logging and data
                access controls will increase.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now we have three plans: a free tier (which is admittedly
                very limited but intended to give you a feel for the product),
                the business plan which starts at $500pm which gets you access
                to the data integration as well as the most powerful models like
                GPT 4 32k, Anthropic 100k etc, and an enterprise plan which
                starts at $5000pm, which is a scaled up version of the business
                tier and lets you go on-prem (more details on each plan are on
                the website). You can try the free tier self-serve, but we
                haven’t yet built out fully self service onboarding for the paid
                plans so for now it is a “book a meeting” button, apologies!
                (But it only takes 5 minutes and if you want it, we can fully
                onboard you in the meeting itself).
              </p>
              <p>
                When Jack and I started Credal, we actually set out to solve a
                different problem: an ‘AI Chief of Staff’ that could read your
                documents and task trackers, and guide your strategic decision
                making. We knew that data security was going to be a critical
                problem for enterprises. Jack and I were both deep in the
                Enterprise Data Security + AI space before Credal, so we
                naturally took a security first approach to building out our AI
                Chief of Staff. But in reality, when we started showing the
                product to customers, we learned pretty fast that the ‘Chief of
                Staff’ features were at best nice to have, and the security
                features were what they were actually excited by. So we stripped
                the product back to basics, and built out the thing our
                customers actually needed. Since then we’ve signed a bunch of
                customers and thousands of users, which has been really
                exciting.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that our product is concretely helping a bunch of people at
                work, is SOC 2 T1 Compliant, and is ready for anyone to just
                walk up and use, we’re super excited to share it with the Hacker
                News community, which Jack and I have been avid readers of for a
                decade now. It’s still a very early product (the private beta
                opened in March), but we can’t wait to get your feedback and see
                how we can make it even better!

              <p>
                We're huge podcast fans, but found we never had enough time to
                soak it all in. So, we built Scribbler - a tool that leverages
                GPT to condense podcast episodes into bite-sized summaries for
                when life's too busy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, we can catch the best bits from any episode, discover new
                shows, and best of all, stop wasting valuable time figuring out
                what's worth listening to and what's not. We hope you'll find it
                useful!

              <p>
                Whether that was a programming blog post or documentation, I
                always had to move back an forth between different editors, and
                sometimes even other apps for content management and the actual
                content publication. A lot of copy-pasting, and wasted time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on this experience I decided to try and build a tool that
                could provide a good experience for this kind of content from
                writing to publishing. This (I call it Vrite) ended up being
                essentially a headless CMS, but optimized for technical content
                and a pretty unique one overall, I'd say.
              </p>
              <p>
                I tried to combine what can be seen as 3 separate products into
                one: - WYSIWYG editor (with the addition of code-specific
                tooling like code editor or formatter) - Kanban dashboard
                (inspired by my experience of tools like Trello used in larger
                technical content teams to manage content production process) -
                The actual headless CMS (content delivery via API, integrations,
                etc.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Most recently I decided to open-source it and see if there's any
                interest in such a tool. Right now the primary focus was my
                personal use-case (kind-of "promotional" technical writing seen
                in programming and start-up blogs), but I think, with more
                customization, something like this could extend to the
                documentation space and make writing and managing docs a lot
                easier.
              </p>

            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://resend.com">https://resend.com</a>). We're
              building a modern email sending platform focused on providing the
              best developer experience.
              <p>
                Why? When you look at all the biggest competitors like Sendgrid,
                Mailgun, Postmark, and SparkPost, you'll notice that they were
                all founded around 2009/2010, and they all have been acquired by
                now. Because of that, it's common to see them only prioritizing
                enterprise requirements and optimizing for sales-led growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nobody is building an exceptional developer experience. Nobody
                is trying to innovate. There isn't a single developer-first
                email platform in the market today. We want to change that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Email sending is the kind of thing that you should integrate and
                forget, but instead, you have…
              </p>
              <p>
                - Templates that are hard to build: Typically, you can only send
                emails using HTML or plain text. Although we support both, we're
                introducing a new way of developing and sending your emails.
                With Resend, you can code your email using React instead of
                outdated &lt;table&gt; layouts thanks to our open source project
                (<a href="https://react.email">https://react.email</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                - Slow performance: Current solutions only offer a single region
                for email sending, even when all your end users are located in
                another part of the world. We allow you to choose what region
                your emails should be sent from (US, Europe, or LATAM), which
                minimizes latency and improves time-to-inbox.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Poor observability: Most tools keep you in the dark without
                knowing what really happened after you sent an email. Resend
                exposes all the events associated with your email via webhooks.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Designed for marketers only: Existing solutions are too
                generic and built exclusively for product marketers and product
                managers. We're building a platform with a clean REST API and
                SDKs for Node.js, Python, Ruby, Elixir, Go, and Java. We also
                have examples of how to send emails using Vercel Edge Functions,
                Cloudflare Workers, Supabase Edge Functions, and other
                serverless solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                What's our backstory? When I was a CPO at Liferay, I faced the
                problem of sending emails at scale. We had enterprise customers
                complaining about deliverability, and I've been frustrated with
                existing services ever since. More recently, as a VP of
                Developer Experience at WorkOS, I once again had to deal with
                emails landing in the spam folder. After looking at all the
                different solutions out there, I've been obsessed with the idea
                of solving this problem once and for all.
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to stop developing emails like it's 2010 and rethink how
                email can be done in 2023 and beyond. We believe that email
                development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way
                we build apps today. That's why we're building Resend.
              </p>
              <p>
                What issues have you had with email sending? I would love to
                hear your ideas, experiences, and feedback on any and all of the
                above.
