              >), an AI agent interpretability tool to help observe/debug AI
              agents.
              <p>
                Here is a demo:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/Zvoh1QUMhXQ"
                  >https://youtu.be/Zvoh1QUMhXQ</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting started is easy with just one line of code. You just
                call lai.init() in your agent code and log into the dashboard.
                You can see traces of each run, cumulative trends across
                sessions, built-in or custom evals, and grouped failure modes.
                Call lai.create_step() with any metadata you want, memory
                snapshots, tool outputs, stateful info, and we'll index it for
                debugging.
              </p>
              <p>
                We did NLP research at Stanford AI Lab (SAIL), where we worked
                on creating an AI agent (w/ fine-tuned models and DSPy) to solve
                math olympiad problems (focusing on AIME/USAMO); and we realized
                debugging these agents was hard. But the last straw was when we
                built an e-commerce agent that could buy items online. It kept
                failing at checkout, and every one-line change, tweaking a
                prompt, switching to Llama, adjusting tool logic, meant another
                10-minute rerun just to see if we hit the same checkout page.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this point, we were all like, this sucks, so we improved
                agent interpretability with better debugging, monitoring, and
                evals.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started by listening to users who told us traditional LLM
                observability platforms don't capture the complexity of agents.
                Agents have tools, memories, events, not just input/output
                pairs. So we automatically transform OTel (and/or regular) agent
                logs into interactive graph visualizations that cluster similar
                states based on memory and action patterns. We heard that people
                wanted to test small changes even with the graphs, so we created
                “time traveling,” where you can modify any state (memory
                contents, tool outputs, context), then re-simulate 30–40 times
                to see outcome distributions. We embed the responses, cluster by
                similarity, and show which modifications lead to stable vs.
                divergent behaviors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then we saw people running their agent 10 times on the same
                task, watching each run individually, and wasting hours looking
                at mostly repeated states. So we built trajectory clustering on
                similar state embeddings (like similar tools or memories) to
                surface behavioral patterns across mass simulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                We then use that to create a force-directed layout that
                automatically groups similar paths your agent took, which
                displays states as nodes, actions as edges, and failure
                probability as color intensity. The clusters make failure
                patterns obvious; you see trends across hundreds of runs, not
                individual traces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, when people saw our observability features, they
                naturally wanted evaluation capabilities. So we developed a
                concept for people to make their own evals called "rubrics,"
                which lets you define specific criteria, assign weights to each
                criterion, and set score definitions, giving you a structured
                way to measure agent performance against your exact
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate these criteria, we used our own platform to build an
                investigator agent that reviews your criteria and evaluates
                performance much more effectively than traditional
                LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

              <p>
                I've been into launching weather balloons for a few years. One
                aspect of the hobby that really drew me in was the tracking side
                of things. Tracking systems let you follow the balloon's
                position throughout the flight and, most importantly, know
                exactly where it lands so you can recover the instrumentation.
                APRS is what I started out using during my first few years in
                the hobby, after I got my amateur radio license in 2020 (W0MXX).
                I designed a few small boards using the trackuino (<a
                  href="https://github.com/trackuino/trackuino"
                  >https://github.com/trackuino/trackuino</a
                >) firmware (while breaking 3 $70 radio modules along the way).
              </p>
              <p>
                I then got into recovering radiosondes, which are launched twice
                per day by the NWS and can be reprogrammed using RS41ng (<a
                  href="https://github.com/mikaelnousiainen/RS41ng"
                  >https://github.com/mikaelnousiainen/RS41ng</a
                >) to run many amateur radio tracking protocols. I was a bit
                dissatisfied with how large and heavy the radiosonde trackers
                were, so I designed my own tracking system, called Tiny4FSK.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tiny4FSK is a flight computer with built-in tracking using the
                Horus Binary v2 tracking system. This protocol was developed by
                the Project Horus team specifically for high-altitude balloons,
                and it brings features like high transmit rates, forward error
                correction, and excellent weak-signal performance in an open
                source package. It's designed to be as compact as possible and
                can run on a single AA battery for upwards of 17 hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main board comes with header rows that allow for
                out-of-the-box expansion. I developed a shield that supports the
                BME280 environmental sensor, the ICM-20948 9-axis IMU, and more
                via the Qwiic connector. It also features an OLED display for
                basic diagnostics.
              </p>
              <p>
                While I've pretty much polished the main tracking procedures
                (and have tested on multiple flights), I'm still developing the
                IMU code using a lightweight Kalman filter. Additionally, there
                isn't yet a wide network of Horus Binary decoding stations like
                the APRS network has (I-gates), but I hope that by promoting
                this protocol, more stations will pop up. This means that if
                you're not in an area with many receive stations, you'll need to
                set up your own using either Horus-GUI (<a
                  href="https://github.com/projecthorus/horus-gui"
                  >https://github.com/projecthorus/horus-gui</a
                >) or horusdemodlib (<a
                  href="https://github.com/projecthorus/horusdemodlib"
                  >https://github.com/projecthorus/horusdemodlib</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                One issue I’m still working on is improving RF signal strength.
                Although the protocol is decodable in very low-noise
                environments, the transmit power appears to be lower than that
                of a typical radiosonde. This could be due to several factors:
                limited current on a weak power source (signal is stronger when
                powered from a bench supply), off-tuned filtering/matching, or
                not paying enough attention to the antenna. I'm planning to run
                more simulations to figure this out. That said, the signal is
                still decodable from the ground even at max altitude (~100,000
                feet).
              </p>
              <p>
                On the more technical side, Tiny4FSK uses: - the SAMD21
                microcontroller, which is an ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU - the TPS61200
                boost converter, which is adjusted to output 3.3v - Si4063 radio
                module, which I use on the 70cm band - ATGM336H gps module -
                pretty cheap GPS module which works in airborne mode (&gt;18km)
                - integrated BME280 temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor
                The code uses the Arduino framework to make it accessible to
                beginners.
              </p>
              <p>
                All flights using Horus Binary v2, including reprogrammed
                radiosondes, other custom trackers, and Tiny4FSK show up in
                real-time on Sondehub Amateur (<a
                  href="https://amateur.sondehub.org"
                  >https://amateur.sondehub.org</a
                >). Flight data can be found in the /Media/Data folder on Github
                (there's several missing flights on there though).

              <a href="https://frigade.ai">https://frigade.ai</a>. We’ve built a
              powerful AI agent that automatically learns how to use any
              web-based product, and in turn guides users directly in the UI,
              automatically generates documentation, and even takes actions on a
              user’s behalf. Think of it as Clippy from the old MS Office. But
              on steroids. And actually helpful.
              <p>
                You can see the agent and tool-calling SDK in action here:

              <p>
                How is this different from other AI customer support products?
              </p>
              <p>
                Most AI "copilots" are really just glorified chatbots. They skim
                your help center and spit out some nonspecific bullet points.
                Basically some ‘hopes and prayers’ that your users will figure
                it out. Ultimately, this puts the burden on the user to follow
                through. And assumes companies are keeping their help center
                up-to-date with every product change. That means constant
                screenshots of new product UI or features for accurate
                instructions.These solutions leverage only a fraction of what’s
                possible with AI, which can now reason about software interfaces
                extensively.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Frigade AI, we guide the user directly in the product and
                build on-demand tours based on the current user’s state and
                context. The agents can also take actions immediately on a
                user’s behalf, e.g. inviting a colleague to a workspace or
                retrieving billing information (via our tool calling SDK).
              </p>
              <p>
                This was only made possible recently. The latest frontier models
                (GPT 4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) are able to reason about
                UIs and workflows in a way that simply didn’t work just 6 months
                ago. That’s why we’re so excited to bring this technology to the
                forefront of complex legacy SaaS applications that are not yet
                AI enabled.
              </p>
              <p>How does it work?</p>
              <p>
                1. Invite agent@frigade.ai to your product. You can send
                multiple invitations based on distinct roles.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Our agent automatically explores and reasons about your
                application.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Attach any existing help center resources or training
                documentation to supplement the agent’s understanding. Totally
                optional.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Install the agent assistant Javascript snippet (just a few
                lines).
              </p>
              <p>
                5. That’s it. Your users can now start asking questions and get
                on demand product tours and questions answered in real time
                without any overhead.
              </p>
              <p>
                This process takes only a few minutes. Once running, you can
                improve the agent by rating and providing feedback to the
                responses it provides. If you want to integrate further, you can
                also hook up your own code to our tool calling SDK to enable the
                agent to look up customer info, issue refunds, etc. directly.
                These calls can be made with just a few lines of code by
                describing the tool and its parameters in natural language and
                passing a single Javascript promise (e.g. make an API call, call
                a function in your app, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love to hear what the HN crowd thinks about this approach!
                Are you building your own AI agent from scratch, or looking to
                embed one off the shelf?

              <p>
                About seven months ago, via HN, I got nerdsniped into a silly
                guitar transcription problem and made a bunch of really
                senseless code but what came out of it was what I thought at the
                time could potentially be pretty useful - a guitar fretboard
                mapper and fingering scoring algorithm.
              </p>
              <p>
                So as of yesterday morning I've finally put those bits of code
                to "good" use, creating gtrsnipe to convert between MIDI files
                (.mid) and ASCII tab (as well as VexTab and ABC notation) and
                any combination/direction among the set of formats.
              </p>
              <p>
                gtrsnipe tries to intelligently find the best neck and fingering
                positions using a note to fretboard mapper and a scoring
                algorithm that is unavoidably shaped by my subjective opinions
                and skills as a player but it does its best to avoid objectively
                impossible fingerings.
              </p>
              <p>
                See the example tabs and usage in the README and please, try
                your own transcriptions from MIDI and if you love or hate the
                arrangement it gives you, I'd love to hear about it so I can
                further refine the scoring algorithm.
              </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>
