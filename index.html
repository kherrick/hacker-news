              <p>
                I'm excited to share a small web app I built that allows you to
                view and extract the contents of Windows MSI installers directly
                in your browser. It's essentially a web-based "lessmsi" powered
                by Pyodide.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can try it out at:
                <a href="https://pymsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msi_viewer.html"
                  >https://pymsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msi_viewer.html</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                My motivation for building this was from part of my day job -- I
                often get Windows MSI installers and need to extract files while
                preserving the relative directory structure and filenames, as
                they would appear after a full installation. The existing tools
                I found were good but limited in which platforms they support:
                lessmsi works great on Windows, while msitools works for
                Linux/macOS. Neither is a truly cross-platform solution that
                works on any major OS.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we developed pymsi (a pure Python library, available on
                GitHub at
                <a href="https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi"
                  >https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi</a
                >) to handle reading and extracting MSI files from Python. Then
                I realized that since pymsi has no native dependencies, it could
                potentially run in a web browser using Pyodide. After a bit of
                "vibe coding" and fixing some "hallucinated" functions/classes
                that don't exist in pymsi, the result was this client-side web
                app.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need an MSI file to experiment with, older versions of
                PowerToys included the installer in .msi form, such as this one:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.21.1/PowerToysSetup-0.21.1-x64.msi"
                  >https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0....</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that the underlying pymsi library hasn't been extensively
                tested against a bunch of MSI installers yet, so there might
                still be lingering bugs. If you come across any issues, please
                don't hesitate to report them in on the GitHub repository (<a
                  href="https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/issues"
                  >https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/issues</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>I'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions!</p>

              <p>
                -- Why bother building a new browser? For the first time since
                Netscape was released in 1994, it feels like we can reimagine
                browsers from scratch for the age of AI agents. The web browser
                of tomorrow might not look like what we have today.
              </p>
              <p>
                We saw how tools like Cursor gave developers a 10x productivity
                boost, yet the browser—where everyone else spends their entire
                workday—hasn't fundamentally changed.
              </p>
              <p>
                And honestly, we feel like we're constantly fighting the browser
                we use every day. It's not one big thing, but a series of small,
                constant frustrations. I'll have 70+ tabs open from three
                different projects and completely lose my train of thought. And
                simple stuff like reordering tide pods from amazon or filling
                out forms shouldn't need our full attention anymore. AI can
                handle all of this, and that's exactly what we're building.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a demo of our early version
                <a href="https://dub.sh/nxtscape-demo"
                  >https://dub.sh/nxtscape-demo</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                -- What makes us different We know others are exploring this
                space (Perplexity, Dia), but we want to build something
                open-source and community-driven. We're not a search or ads
                company, so we can focus on being privacy-first – Ollama
                integration, BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys), ad-blocker.
              </p>
              <p>
                Btw we love what Brave started and stood for, but they've now
                spread themselves too thin across crypto, search, etc. We are
                laser-focused on one thing: making browsers work for YOU with
                AI. And unlike Arc (which we loved too but got abandoned), we're
                100% open source. Fork us if you don't like our direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                -- Our journey hacking a new browser To build this, we had to
                fork Chromium. Honestly, it feels like the only viable path
                today—we've seen others like Brave (started with electron) and
                Microsoft Edge learn this the hard way.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also started with why not just build an extension. But
                realized we needed more control. Similar to the reason why
                Cursor forked VSCode. For example, Chrome has this thing called
                the Accessibility Tree - basically a cleaner, semantic version
                of the DOM that screen readers use. Perfect for AI agents to
                understand pages, but you can't use it through extension APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                That said, working with the 15M-line C++ chromium codebase has
                been an adventure. We've both worked on infra at Google and
                Meta, but Chromium is a different beast. Tools like Cursor's
                indexing completely break at this scale, so we've had to get
                really good with grep and vim. And the build times are
                brutal—even with our maxed-out M4 Max MacBook, a full build
                takes about 3 hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                Full disclosure: we are still very early, but we have a working
                prototype on GitHub. It includes an early version of a "local
                Manus" style agent that can automate simple web tasks, plus an
                AI sidebar for questions, and other productivity features
                (grouping tabs, saving/resuming sessions, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>Looking forward to any and all comments!</p>
