            <div class="text">
              <p>
                This was largely inspired by the work of Sydney Brenner, which
                became the basis of my brennerbot.org project.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, I became very fascinated by phages, which are
                viruses that attack bacteria. They're the closest thing to the
                "fundamental particles" of biology: the minimal units of genetic
                code that do something useful that allows them to reproduce and
                spread.
              </p>
              <p>
                They also have some incredible properties, like having a
                structure that somehow encodes an icosahedron.
              </p>
              <p>
                I always wondered how the DNA of these things translated into
                geometry in the physical world. That mapping between the
                "digital" realm of ACGT, which in turn maps onto the 20 amino
                acids in groups of 3, and the world of 3D, analog shapes, still
                seems magical and mysterious to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to dig deeper into the subject, but not by reading a
                boring textbook. I wanted to get a sense for these phages in a
                tangible way. What are the different major types of phages? How
                do they compare to each other in terms of the length and
                structure of their genetic code? The physical structure they
                assume?
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to make a program to explore all this stuff in an
                interactive way.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so I'm very pleased to present you with my open-source Phage
                Explorer:
              </p>
              <p>phage-explorer.org</p>
              <p>
                I probably went a bit overboard, because what I ended up with
                has taken a sickening number of tokens to generate, and resulted
                in ~150k lines of Typescript and Rust/Wasm.
              </p>
              <p>
                It implements 23 analysis algorithms, over 40 visualizations,
                and has the complete genetic data and 3D structure of 24
                different classes of phage.
              </p>
              <p>
                It actually took a lot of engineering to make this work well in
                a browser; it's a surprising amount of data (this becomes
                obvious when you look at some of the 3D structure models).
              </p>
              <p>
                It works fairly well on mobile, but if you want to get the full
                experience, I highly recommend opening it on a desktop browser
                in high resolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                As far as I know, it's the most complete informational /
                educational software about phages available anywhere. Now, I am
                the first to admit that I'm NOT an expert, or even that
                knowledgeable, about, well, ANY of this stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
                So if you’re a biology expert, please take a look and let me
                know what you think of what I've made! And if I've gotten
                anything wrong, please let me know in the GitHub Issues and I'll
                fix it:

              <p>
                I built TalkBits because most language apps focus on vocabulary
                or exercises, but not actual conversation. The hard part of
                learning a language is speaking naturally under pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                TalkBits lets you have real-time spoken conversations with an AI
                that acts like a native speaker. You can choose different
                scenarios (travel, daily life, work, etc.), speak naturally, and
                the AI responds with natural speech back.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal is to make it feel like talking to a real person rather
                than doing lessons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Techwise, it uses realtime speech input, transcription, LLM
                responses, and tts streaming to keep latency low so the
                conversation feels fluid.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m specially interested in feedback about: – Does it feel
                natural? – Where does the conversation break immersion? – What
                would make you use this regularly?
              </p>
              <p>Happy to answer technical questions too.</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I’m a builder and user of Obsidian, validating a concept called
                Concerns. Today it’s only a landing page + short survey (no
                product yet) to test whether this pain is real.
              </p>
              <p>The core idea (2–3 bullets):</p>
              <p>
                - Many of us capture tons of useful info (notes/links/docs), but
                it rarely becomes shipped work.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Instead of better “organization” (tags/folders), I’m exploring
                an “action engine” that:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  1.detects what you’re actively targetting/working on (“active projects”)

  2.surfaces relevant saved material at the right moment

  3.proposes a concrete next action (ideally pushed into your existing task tool)
</code></pre>
              My own “second brain” became a graveyard of good intentions: the
              organizing tax was higher than the value I got back. I’m trying to
              validate whether the real bottleneck is execution, not capture.
              <p>Before writing code, I’m trying to pin down two things:</p>
              <p>
                - Project context signals (repo/PRs? issues? tasks? calendar? a
                “project doc”?)
              </p>
              <p>
                - How to close the loop: ingest knowledge → rank against active
                projects → emit a small set of next-actions into an existing
                todo tool → learn from outcomes (done/ignored/edited) and
                optionally write back the minimal state. The open question:
                what’s the cleanest feedback signal without creating noise or
                privacy risk? (explicit ratings vs completion events vs
                doc-based write-back)
              </p>
              <p>What I’m asking from you:</p>
              <p>1.Where does your “second brain” break down the most?</p>
              <p>
                capture / organization / retrieval / execution (If you can,
                share a concrete recent example.)
              </p>
              <p>
                2.What best represents “active project context” for you today?
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  task project (Todoist/Things/Reminders)

  issues/boards (GitHub/Linear/Jira)

  a doc/wiki page (Notion/Docs)

  calendar

  "in my head"
</code></pre>
              Which one would you actually allow a tool to read?
              <p>
                3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that suggests actions from
                your notes/links? (pick 1–2)
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  privacy/data retention

  noisy suggestions / interruption

  hallucinations / wrong suggestions

  workflow change / migration cost

  pricing

  others</code></pre>
