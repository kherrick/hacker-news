              <p>
                Now, I almost never see engineering blog posts or HN posts
                highlighting use of message queues. I see occasional content
                related to Kafka, but nothing like the hype that message queues
                used to have.
              </p>
              <p>What changed? Possible theories I'm aware of:</p>
              <p>
                * Redis tackled most of the use-case, plus caching, so it no
                longer made sense to pay the operational cost of running a
                separate message broker. Kafka picked up the really high-scale
                applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Databases (broadly defined) got a lot better at handling high
                scale, so system designers moved more of the "transient"
                application state into the main data stores.
              </p>
              <p>
                * We collectively realize that message queues-based
                architectures don't work as well as we hoped, so we build most
                things in other ways now.
              </p>
              <p>
                * The technology just got mature enough that it's not exciting
                to write about, but it's still really widely used.
              </p>
              <p>
                If people have experience designing or implementing greenfield
                systems based on message queues, I'd be curious to hear about
                it. I'd also be interested in understanding any war stories or
                pain points people have had from using message queues in
                production systems.

              A few years ago, right after high school, I decided to try to make
              a simultaneous translation app for Android as a side project, it
              took longer than expected (about 2 years) and I had to make a lot
              of compromises (I had to use Google's API and therefore make users
              use a developer key because at the time there were no free
              solutions for speech recognition and translation that had good
              quality). At the end of university, I decided to pick it up again
              and finally, using OpenAi's Whisper for speech recognition and
              Meta's NLLB for translation (with both running locally on the
              phone), I managed to make it free and totally open-source (as it
              was meant to be from the beginning). The app is still in beta, so
              I would love your feedback.

              <p>
                Most traditional music composition tools revolve around the idea
                of a repeatable pattern. Billard is a webapp that never repeats
                itself. It generates music automatically based on the collisions
                of balls in a 2D space. Collisions trigger notes (or chords) in
                a given key. One can add balls or move them (y-position is
                pitch); the app remembers its state between reloads; or it can
                be reset with the 'init' button on the top left. Gravity can be
                adjusted in real time to change the behavior of the balls.
              </p>
              <p>
                It owes a lot of inspiration to Brian Eno and Erik Satie
                (inventor of <i>musique d'ameublement</i>, or "furniture
                music"). Some may think the lack of pattern makes it not musical
                enough -- but this lets it be listened to —and watched— for a
                while without boredom.
              </p>
              <p>
                The webapp is made using plain JavaScript. (All SVG icons were
                made 'by hand'.) It uses Tone.js only for triggering piano
                samples. Beyond piano, it's MIDI-enabled and works well at slow
                speed with haunting, dark synth sounds.
              </p>
              <p>Hope you like it!</p>

                But this leads to a higher level question. When you want to
                sponsor open source bug fixes and/or feature and there isn't a
                clear "sponsor" link or button, how do you find qualified
