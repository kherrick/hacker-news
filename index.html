              <p>
                In the past ~8 months, I have been working on a side project
                that helps me plan my travels. While most months saw no or
                little progress, in the past ~3 months I have been adding tons
                of features to support my next big trip later this year.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've written in my blog on the feature set [1] but in short they
                are:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Timetable view of activities, accommodations, and day plans
              </p>
              <p>- List view and map view of them</p>
              <p>- Commenting on them</p>
              <p>- Expense tracker</p>
              <p>- Sharing and collaboration with friends</p>
              <p>The source code is also available on GitHub [2]</p>
              <p>This is an example of a view-only trip: [3]</p>
              <p>
                So far, I think I'm satisfied with the features and is
                progressing really well in my travel planning.
              </p>

                What it does is map the frames from the HDMI input onto a
                virtual display that is controlled by the IMU data from the
                glasses ( 3DOF only ). I've put AR in quotes in the title
                because many won't view those display glasses as true AR but by
                tracking the head movement it comes close.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am trying to build kind of a "low cost" version of a virtual
                screen that acts like a monitor and can be connected to anything
                that has an HDMI output
              </p>
              <p>
                I started off using the official Viture SDK to interact with the
                glasses but have since switched to a reverse engineered
                implementation of the protocol because their SDK is not
                available for ARM
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is a video showing the first version:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6w5kAA22Ts"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6w5kAA22Ts</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Big caveat: Performance still needs to improve a lot because the
                whole frame reading/converting is completely unoptimized for
                now.
              </p>
              <p>
                What other solutions do exist out there? * Streaming the
                computer screen to a headset like Meta Quest/Vision Pro *
                Connecting a HDMI capture dongle to the Meta Quest directly *
                XReal Beam ( basically the same as this project but official and
                for XReal glasses )
              </p>
              <p>
                And for the obvious question, why I am not use something like a
                Quest or Vision Pro 1. Comfort 2. Price 3. Comfort
              </p>
              <p>
                After using those display glasses over HMDs it's hard to
                convince myself to use a headset for productivity again

                underestimated the work required to make a longer in-depth video
                with voiceover, edited footage, etc.

                We decided to launch our "course" as an MCP server. This way
                your coding agent actually teaches the course content to you and
                can help you write the code. We think this is a really
                interactive way to learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using an editor with MCP support (such as Cursor, Windsurf, or
                VSCode), your code agent will call the appropriate MCP tools
                which will return context for the agent. This context tries to
                instruct the agent that it should be teaching you the content,
                not just doing the work for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The course is still pretty experimental and some models work
                better than others. Code is available in the Mastra Github repo
                in the mcp-docs-server package (<a

                We are bringing an upgraded version of the long beloved SO-101
                robot arms to a $219 price point with improved mechanical design
                and added intelligence. See what it can do here:

              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve spent a few years building RC planes (<a
                  href="https://cyo.ng/hangar/"
                  >https://cyo.ng/hangar/</a
                >) and micro gas turbines (<a href="https://set.mit.edu"
                  >https://set.mit.edu</a
                >), and I’ve always wished hardware were cheaper so more people
                could experiment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m now launching a $219 desktop robot-arm kit that keeps
                LeRobot SO-101’s kinematics, swaps key parts for sturdier, more
                precise SLA prints, and adds two integrated 480 p cameras. After
                plenty of supplier haggling, the whole kit costs less than the
                twelve servos alone. I’ll release the updated mechanical design
                under an MIT license by June 30.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the software side, I'll also release an MIT-licensed MCP
                server by June 30 that exposes the local robot policy as tools
                for agentic LLMs (Opus 4, o3, etc.) to use in long-horizon
                tasks. Here's how it works: You can teach the robot new skills
                through teleoperation. During inference, you simply talk to the
                agentic LLM using natural language instructions. The LLM then
                calls the local robot policy through MCP, automatically
                decomposing your high-level requests into executable robot
                commands.
              </p>
              <p>

                I’d love your feedback! Beyond manufacturing, cleaning up the
                codebase, and writing docs, I’m considering: a force-controlled
                gripper, a parallel-jaw gripper, an extra wrist DOF (matching
                the new Trossen and ARX arms), full force feedback on the leader
                arm (though that may triple the price), a more affordable
                version with lower resolution each joint, and a longer-reach
                variant. Which of these—or something else—would be most useful
                to you?

                is sold out.
              </p>
              <p>
                • The second batch of 100 units will be shipped by July 15
                (unassembled kits) and July 21 (assembled units). The order
                limit is to ensure we can ship on time and maintain high
                quality.
              </p>

            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://bitboard.work">https://bitboard.work</a>). We
              build AI agents that handle repetitive administrative tasks in
              healthcare clinics like filling out intake forms, prepping charts,
              or managing referrals.
              <p>
                We were early employees at Forward, which provided primary care
                across the US. To scale this, we relied on thousands of remote
                contractors to do repetitive administrative work like
                reconciling patient records, and scheduling follow-ups based on
                care plans. It was a huge bottleneck—expensive, error-prone, and
                always pulling attention away from clinical care. Our software
                solutions were always too brittle, never managing to handle the
                variance of clinical data we oversaw.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI, when applied well, is capable of performing a lot of the
                tasks we manually did. So we decided to take another crack at
                the problem by building today what we would have liked to have
                back then, and to help clinics use it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clinics send us their SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures—for
                example, “prep a patient chart from these records before a
                visit”), and we turn them into AI agents that do the work. These
                agents act like remote contractors: they log into EHRs, navigate
                internal tools, and do the work in the background. Unlike
                classical RPA, we build in verification and deterministic
                checks, so customers can confirm it was done right. Unlike
                low-code tools, there’s nothing new to learn. Customers don’t
                have to touch a UI or maintain logic. They just hand us the
                task, and we do it. Clinicians don’t want more screens! They
                erode attention and cause weird bottlenecks in operations
                because someone has to drive them. Our product is built to
                address this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a demo video:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g</a
                >. We’re not self-serve yet, but we deploy with customers in
                days after onboarding them. We’re working on speeding that up.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of our early customers is a fast-growing obesity medicine
                group. Their MAs were spending 15 to 20 minutes per patient just
                entering intake form data into the EHR. That one task was taking
                up 30% of their MA time. We took it over in a week. It’s now
                fully automated, and they’ve cleared the backlog and sped up
                visits.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few technical problems are specifically relevant to building
                healthcare agents:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Unreliable interfaces: many EHRs and clinic tools don’t follow
                modern web standards, making automation brittle. We’ve forked
                browser-use to solve some of these challenges. We’re working on
                analogous infrastructure to let agents operate on desktops and
                across a wide range of APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Verification: in healthcare, tasks need to be provably
                correct. We embed deterministic checks into each workflow so
                agents can confirm the task was completed as expected and the
                output is accurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Workflow generation: clinic SOPs are written in natural
                language and vary widely, yet still describe the actual process
                that works for clinics.
              </p>
              <p>
                We charge per task, based on complexity. We’re HIPAA compliant,
                audit-logged, and operate in a zero-retention environment unless
                auditing requires otherwise.
              </p>
              <p>
                A meaningful part is building trust in a high-stakes environment
                like healthcare. Part of that is making the product reliable.
                But another educational part is learning how to introduce a new
                concept like “agents” to clinics. We’re working on the right
                ways to describe them, to onboard them, to measure them.
                Endearingly, one of our customers’ agents is named “Robert Ott”,
                and they refer to him by name in their weekly updates like he’s
                a member of the team :) We’re learning a lot and have a long way
                to go.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love to meet other folks who 1. work in medical groups or
                health systems and want to offload repetitive work, and 2. are
                building in this space and want to trade notes. We’re happy to
                share everything we’ve learned so far.
              </p>
              <p>
                And this is a big space, with a lot of learnings from personal
                stories, from clinicians, technologists, administrators, and
                more. What do you make of it? We’d love to hear from you.
