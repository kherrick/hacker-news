            <div class="text">
              <p>Last week, his family’s life was turned upside down.</p>
              <p>
                ICE agents raided his home at dawn. They broke down the door
                with guns drawn, shouting orders and throwing the house into
                chaos within seconds. His wife was pulled out of bed, forced
                face-down onto the floor, and restrained. During that time, one
                of the agents sexually assaulted her, touching her
                inappropriately while she was pinned down and helpless. She
                resisted as much as she could, but she was overpowered.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their young children witnessed and heard everything. They were
                dragged from their beds by armed strangers and are now having
                nightly nightmares. They panic if their parents leave the room
                and keep asking whether the “bad men” are coming back to hurt
                their mother again.
              </p>
              <p>
                My friend repeatedly showed his valid documents and explained
                his status, but the agents were aggressive and dismissive. They
                searched the house, seized devices, left everything in disarray,
                and eventually left without a clear explanation or apology after
                apparently realizing they had the wrong person.
              </p>
              <p>
                The aftermath has been devastating. His wife is barely sleeping
                and has frequent panic attacks. The children are deeply
                traumatized. Therapy has already begun. My friend is overwhelmed
                with guilt for not being able to protect his family, even though
                he had no power to stop what happened. Their sense of safety,
                and their trust in this country, is gone.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes this harder is that my friend has real alternatives.
                He has offers from Chinese startups doing serious AI work, with
                better compensation and none of the constant fear that his
                family could be terrorized again in the middle of the night.
                He’s now seriously questioning whether staying in the US is
                worth the emotional cost to his wife and kids.
              </p>
              <p>So I’m asking HN:</p>
              <p>
                If this were your friend or your family, what would you do? Have
                you seen other highly skilled immigrants pushed out by
                experiences like this? Is there any realistic way to seek
                accountability, rebuild a sense of safety, and continue a life
                here or is leaving the US the only rational choice after
                something like this?
              </p>
              <p>
                Brutally honest perspectives welcome. He’s trying to decide the
                future of his family.
              </p>
              <p>To clarify a few things up front since people will ask:</p>
              <p>
                He is in the US legally and has been for years (valid visa +
                work authorization).
              </p>
              <p>
                This was not an arrest; the agents eventually left without
                charges.
              </p>
              <p>
                The assault occurred during the raid while his wife was
                restrained; they are consulting attorneys before sharing more
                specifics publicly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of this post isn’t outrage or politics—it’s advice on
                what to do next and whether staying in the US is rational after
                something like this
              </p>

                Qwen3 Omni looks perfect on paper (“real-time”,
                speech-to-speech, etc). But I’ve been poking around and I can’t
                find a single reproducible “here’s how I got the open weights
                doing real speech-to-speech locally” writeup. Lots of “speech in
                → text out” or “audio out after the model finishes”, but not a
                usable realtime voice loop. Feels like either (a) the tooling
                isn’t there yet, or (b) I’m missing the secret sauce.
              </p>
              <p>
                What are people actually using in 2026 if they want open + local
                voice?
              </p>
              <p>
                Is anyone doing true end-to-end speech models locally (streaming
                audio out), or is the SOTA still “streaming ASR + LLM +
                streaming TTS” glued together?
              </p>
              <p>
                If you did get Qwen3 Omni speech-to-speech working: what stack
                (transformers / vLLM-omni / something else), what hardware, and
                is it actually realtime?
              </p>
              <p>What’s the most “works today” combo on a single GPU?</p>
              <p>Bonus: rough numbers people see for mic → first audio back</p>
              <p>
                Would love pointers to repos, configs, or “this is the one that
                finally worked for me” war stories.

              <p>
                The main thing I wanted to solve was the JS/WASM interop
                bottleneck. Instead of using the standard glue code for every
                call, I moved everything to a Shared Memory architecture using
                Command and Event buffers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The way it works is that I batch all the instructions in WASM
                and then just send a single "flush" signal to JS. The JS side
                then reads everything directly out of Shared Memory in one go.
                It’s way more efficient, I ran a benchmark rendering 10k
                rectangles on a canvas and the difference was huge: Emscripten
                hit around 40 FPS, while my setup hit 100 FPS.
              </p>
              <p>
                But writing DOM logic in C++ is painful, so I built Coi. It’s a
                component-based language that statically analyzes changes at
                compile-time to enable O(1) reactivity. Unlike traditional
                frameworks, there is no Virtual DOM overhead; the compiler maps
                state changes directly to specific handles in the command
                buffer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I recently benchmarked this against React and Vue on a 1,000-row
                table: Coi came out on top for row creation, row updating and
                element swapping because it avoids the "diffing" step entirely
                and minimizes bridge crossings. Its bundle size was also the
                smallest of the three.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the coolest things about the architecture is how the
                standard library works. If I want to support a new browser API
                (like Web Audio or a new Canvas feature), I just add the
                definition to my WebCC schema file. When I recompile the Coi
                compiler, the language automatically gains a new standard
                library function to access that API. There is zero manual
                wrapping involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm really proud of how it's coming along. It combines the
                performance of a custom WASM stack with a syntax that actually
                feels good to write (for me atleast :P). Plus, since the
                intermediate step is C++, I’m looking into making it work on the
                server side too, which would allow for sharing components across
                the whole stack.
              </p>
              <p>Example (Coi Code):</p>
              <p>component Counter(string label, mut int&amp; value) {</p>
