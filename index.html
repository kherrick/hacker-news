            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I lost my job during COVID. My family pulled all support,
                leading me to be evicted due to nonpayment of rent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Flash forward, the folks I got tenure, internships, and jobs
                have not connected me with work.
              </p>
              <p>
                I lowered my standards and applied to things like dishwasher
                with no luck.
              </p>
              <p>
                I feel harassed, and exhausted my savings on a Bellingcat
                certification and verifying my eligibility for Italian
                citienship.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is that what I should do... emigrate back where I came from?
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently in a hotel that lacks basic anemities like a
                functioning shower, paid monthly by family who demand I "get a
                job" but don't help in that matter... when the medical advice I
                was given was to cut ties.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is complicated by things like being an activist but... I
                was a feminist. I was a hacker. I was kind to people. My heart
                is broken, and not in a romantic way -- they took advantage of
                me, always one offer at a time, forcing me back to have guns
                pointed at me and abuse hurled.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyways, how did you escape this? Are there specific nonprofits
                in states other than PA?
              </p>
              <p>Did you speak to an embassy?</p>
              <p>
                How do I avoid a situation where I get as upset as I am right
                now and do something extreme?
              </p>
              <p>
                Everyone I met in this predicament, it was due to severe mental
                illness (like, schitzophrenia, etc) or a severe substance abuse
                issue.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took years off from drinking, and am perfectly capable of
                having just one Guiness socially.
              </p>
              <p>
                I struglle, some days, to contain my anxiety, because I'm
                literally homeless and I am that way because I wouldn't tolerate
                bad behaviors -- we removed some politicans, arrested others.
              </p>
              <p>
                It feels like I'm nudged down a dark path, and I wanted to ask
                for help -- someone posted a link ages ago for jobs for people
                with depression...
              </p>
              <p>
                They told me in grad school you're not depressed per se... you
                have C-PTSD... a series of events.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm capable of controlling it, but... it requires not being
                reliant on handouts, or I have to make bad decisions like "eat a
                big breakfast of meats I found in a charity fridge, let my blood
                sugar drop having too much caffeine so I can wait til dinnertime
                to eat again because I can't afford to buy food in the place
                that's nice enough to give me hot water if I sit in the corner"
              </p>
              <p>
                Are folks willing to help? Or am I just a signal in the noise to
                be discarded when I'm no longer useful? I've never killed or
                raped anyone. I'm not a monster.
              </p>
              <p>Why won't anyone help me?</p>

              <p>
                I have been a solo dev / indie hacker for a few (many?) years
                until recently when I added 2 people to my team (one engineer
                and one for marketing). Initially when adding them to my team I
                was kind of relieved that they would solve certain problems for
                me however after a few weeks I learnt while they do what I ask
                of them they also create new problems for me and I need to
                prepare a lot more which leaves less time to work solo. My
                impulsive thought at first was that maybe I should go back to
                being solo but soon I realised that I enjoy working solo and
                don’t really know how to be a manager or how to delegate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Has anyone here faced something similar? How did you learn to
                become a manager?
              </p>
              <p>
                I would really appreciate if you could point me to some good
                sources books videos courses any material that could give me a
                good 101 on being a manager and delegating work / using Human
                Resources, also using positive approach whilst giving feedback.
                Also, do you have any heuristics you use to measure your
                effectiveness at delegating?
              </p>
              <p>Any help is appreciated, thanks!</p>
