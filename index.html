              <p>Heres the short pitch.</p>
              <p>
                The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of
                every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings
                surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type
                of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the
                filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment
                activities and allowing the public and other market participants
                to monitor them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome
                to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a
                paywall. Through wallstreetlocal, the SEC's 13F filers become
                more accessible and open.
              </p>
              <p>
                By exploring the website (and the code), you can see the
                resources I used, check out some notable money managers I
                listed, and download any data that suits you. All for free.
                (Note, the mobile site likely needs work.)
              </p>
              <p>
                I made this project to better democratize SEC filings, and also
                to get some experience on my hands. I love computers, and one
                day hope to get involved with startups. In the comments, I'd
                appreciate any and all advice, as well as feedback on how to
                improve the site.

            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://hatchet.run">https://hatchet.run</a>), we're
              working on an open-source, distributed task queue. It's an
              alternative to tools like Celery for Python and BullMQ for
              Node.js, primarily focused on reliability and observability. It
              uses Postgres for the underlying queue.
              <p>
                Why build another managed queue? We wanted to build something
                with the benefits of full transactional enqueueing -
                particularly for dependent, DAG-style execution - and felt
                strongly that Postgres solves for 99.9% of queueing use-cases
                better than most alternatives (Celery uses Redis or RabbitMQ as
                a broker, BullMQ uses Redis). Since the introduction of SKIP
                LOCKED and the milestones of recent PG releases (like
                active-active replication), it's becoming more feasible to
                horizontally scale Postgres across multiple regions and
                vertically scale to 10k TPS or more. Many queues (like BullMQ)
                are built on Redis and data loss can occur when suffering OOM if
                you're not careful, and using PG helps avoid an entire class of
                problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also wanted something that was significantly easier to use
                and debug for application developers. A lot of times the burden
                of building task observability falls on the infra/platform team
                (for example, asking the infra team to build a Grafana view for
                their tasks based on exported prom metrics). We're building this
                type of observability directly into Hatchet.
              </p>
              <p>
                What do we mean by "distributed"? You can run workers (the
                instances which run tasks) across multiple VMs, clusters and
                regions - they are remotely invoked via a long-lived gRPC
                connection with the Hatchet queue. We've attempted to optimize
                our latency to get our task start times down to 25-50ms and much
                more optimization is on the roadmap.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also support a number of extra features that you'd expect,
                like retries, timeouts, cron schedules, dependent tasks. A few
                things we're currently working on - we use RabbitMQ (confusing,
                yes) for pub/sub between engine components and would prefer to
                just use Postgres, but didn't want to spend additional time on
                the exchange logic until we built a stable underlying queue. We
                are also considering the use of NATS for engine-engine and
                engine-worker connections.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'd greatly appreciate any feedback you have and hope you get
                the chance to try out Hatchet.

              <p>
                We experienced the need for this when we were building a copilot
                for bankers. Our RAG pipeline blew up in complexity as we added
                components: a query classifier (to triage user intent), multiple
                retrievers (to grab information from different sources),
                filtering LLM (to rerank / compress context), a calculator agent
                (to call financial functions) and finally the synthesizer LLM
                that gives the answer. Ensuring reliability became more
                difficult with each of these we added.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a bad response was detected by our answer evaluator, we had
                to backtrack multiple steps to understand which component(s)
                made a mistake. But this quickly became unscalable beyond a few
                samples.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did my Ph.D. in fault detection for autonomous vehicles, and I
                see a strong parallel between the complexity of autonomous
                driving software and today's LLM pipelines. In self-driving
                systems, sensors, perception, prediction, planning, and control
                modules are all chained together. To ensure system-level safety,
                we use granular metrics to measure the performance of each
                module individually. When the vehicle makes an unexpected
                decision, we use these metrics to pinpoint the problem to a
                specific component. Only then we can make targeted improvements,
                systematically.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on this thinking, we developed the first version of
                continuous-eval for ourselves. Since then we’ve made it more
                flexible to fit various types of GenAI pipelines.
                Continuous-eval allows you to describe (programmatically) your
                pipeline and modules, and select metrics for each module. We
                developed 30+ metrics to cover retrieval, text generation, code
                generation, classification, agent tool use, etc. We now have a
                number of companies using us to test complex pipelines like
                finance copilots, enterprise search, coding agents, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an example, one customer was trying to understand why their
                RAG system did poorly on trend analysis queries. Through
                continuous-eval, they realized that the “retriever” component
                was retrieving 80%+ of all relevant chunks, but the “reranker”
                component, that filters out “irrelevant” context, was dropping
                that to below 50%. This enabled them to fix the problem, in
                their case by skipping the reranker for certain queries.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve also built ensemble metrics that do a surprisingly good
                job of predicting user feedback. Users often rate LLM-generated
                answers by giving a thumbs up/down about how good the answer
                was. We train our custom metrics on this user data, and then use
                those metrics to generate thumbs up/down ratings on future LLM
                answers. The results turn out to be 90% aligned with what the
                users say. This gives developers a feedback loop from production
                data to offline testing and development. Some customers have
                found this to be our most unique advantage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, to make the most out of evaluation, you should use a
                diverse dataset—ideally with ground truth labels for
                comprehensive and consistent assessment. Because ground truth
                labels are costly and time-consuming to curate manually, we also
                have a synthetic data generation pipeline that allows you to get
                started quickly. Try it here (<a

                It's the #1 most requested thing I've been hearing from open
                source model builders: the ability to use multiple GPUs with
                QLoRA training. So that's why we decided to make it our first
                project.

              <a href="https://silogy.io/">https://silogy.io/</a>). We’re
              building chip design and verification tools to speed up the
              semiconductor development cycle. Here's a demo:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wAegt79EA"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wAegt79EA</a
              >
              <p>
                Interest in designing new chips is growing, thanks to demand
                from AI and the predicted decline of Moore’s Law. All these
                chips need to be tested in simulation. Since the number of
                possible states grows exponentially with chip complexity, the
                need for verification is exploding. Chip developers already
                spend 70% of their time on testing. (See this video on the
                “verification gap”:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaaOdGuMCc"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaaOdGuMCc</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Tooling hasn’t kept up. The state of the art in collaborative
                debugging is to walk to a coworker’s desk and point to an error
                in a log file or waveform file. Each chip company rolls out its
                own tooling and infra to deal with this—this was Kay’s (one of
                our cofounders) entire job at his last gig. But they want to
                work on chips, not devtools! The solutions they come up with are
                often inadequate and frustrating. That’s why we started SiLogy.
              </p>
              <p>
                SiLogy is a web app to manage the entire digital verification
                workflow. (“Digital verification” means testing the logic of the
                design and includes everything before the physical design of the
                chip. It’s the most time-consuming stage in verification.)
              </p>
              <p>We combine three capabilities:</p>
              <p>
                <i>Test orchestration and running</i>: The heart of our product
                is a CI tool that runs Verilator, a popular open-source
                simulator, in a Docker container. When you push to your repo or
                manually trigger a job in the UI, we install your dependencies
                and compile your binaries into a Docker image, and run your
                tests. You can also rerun a single test with custom arguments
                using the UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Test results and statistics</i>: We display logs from each
                test in the web app. We’re working on displaying waveform files
                in the app, too. We also keep track of passing and failing tests
                within each test suite, and we’re working on slick
                visualizations of test trends, to keep managers happy. :)
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Collaboration</i>: soon you’ll be able to send a link to and
                leave a comment on a specific location within a log or waveform
                file, just like in Google Docs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike generic CI tools, we focus on tight integration with
                verification workflows. When an assertion fails, we show you the
                source code where it happened. We’re hard at work on waveform
                viewing – soon you’ll be able to generate waves from a failing
                test, with the click of a button.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our roadmap includes support for the major commercial
                simulators: VCS, Xcelium, and Questa. We’re also working on a
                test gen framework based on Buck2 to statically declare tests
                for your post-commit runs, or programmatically generate
                thousands of tests for nightly regressions.
              </p>
              <p>
                We plan to sell seats, with discounts for individuals, startups,
                and research labs (we’re working on pricing). For now, we’re
                opening up guest registration so HN can play with what we hope
                is the future of design verification. We owe so much of what we
                know to this community and we’d be so grateful for any feedback.

                4 years behind, 9 ideas with 0$ mrr, thousands of hours on my
                ass, living on credit, dreaming and here I have my first 57
                sales (one-time payments) for 1539$ in just 2 months. I was
                happy, but not for long.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned an interesting detail, making the first sales doesn't
                mean that the idea will eventually survive and work in the long
                run. It just shows that the idea is proven.
              </p>
              <p>
                All my sales came from non-scalable channels (telegram chat with
                marketing strategists). I started looking for the same segment
                online:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Buying promotional posts on telegram. - Wrote articles on
                local startup sites. - Did search advertising in yandex.direct,
                google ads - I did sms mailing.
              </p>
              <p>Nothing. Not a single sale. Absolutely the same offer.</p>
              <p>
                I have a question. Could it be that it was just a mirage? These
                sales confused me and gave me faith in an idea that is dead? Or
                should I dig further, test hypotheses, spend time looking for a
                segment?
              </p>
              <p>Friends, please share your experiences. Thanks in advance.</p>
