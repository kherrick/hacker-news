              <a href="https://www.goinri.com/">https://www.goinri.com/</a>), an
              investment platform for Indian expats to diversify capital in
              India, without any taxation or repatriation hassles. Super excited
              to be launching on HN, the platform that I personally nerd on and
              has helped me discover some of my favorite products early.
              <p>
                My cofounder Hemant (@hemantgangolia) has been living in the US
                since 6 years and has tried multiple times to invest in India.
                He couldn't go ahead with the process because bank account
                opening was a challenge and the process after that wasn't clear.
                There is complexity around taxation, moving money back and a
                general lack of clarity on where to invest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though there are currently over 30 million Indian expats
                globally, there are no digital, full-service solutions offered
                for them specifically. US solutions focus only on US investments
                and Indian solutions focus only on Indian customers—this makes
                the India &lt;&gt; US belt underserved. Indian banks with
                overseas branches offer these services, but investors don’t
                trust these banks because of conflict of interest. There are
                other small players in the market but they expect customers to
                do their own service, which is not what customers want, based on
                our learnings.
              </p>
              <p>
                We found a lot of other Indian expats in the same situation as
                us - wanting to invest in India for financial and emotional
                reasons, but unable to do so easily or consistently. We wished a
                simple product existed to solve for this online. We couldn’t
                find one, so we built it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inri is like Wealthfront for your India investments. It is a web
                platform that offers curated mutual fund portfolios and solves
                for all tax compliance and repatriation needs online. We have
                curated the funds based on performance, history and compliance
                based on your resident country, and funds are selected based on
                your risk preference, similarly to Wealthfront. We facilitate
                investments through central platforms like National Stock
                Exchange and show the holdings via a dashboard on the platform
                once the investments are done. Additionally, we do this while
                making tax compliance and repatriation easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just log in to the platform, upload your documents, approve the
                emails with details confirmation and you’re sorted. Currently,
                only people with a PAN card (Indian financial identity document)
                can invest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our early customers are all people who have tried doing this
                before, but gave up because of all the hassle. The fact that
                they could get invested in just 2 days vs weeks for traditional
                alternatives was unheard of to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know this is a bit of a niche product for HN but we also know
                that there are quite a few Indian expats like us here, who could
                make use of it—and we hope it makes interesting enough reading
                for everybody else. We would love to get your feedback! Thank
                you!

                avid users and impossible in other apps. It also has a
                lightning-fast, Rust-based window compositing, scaling, and
                streaming engine now.
              </p>
              <p>
                CoScreen was always meant to be different so that you and your
                team can share your screens simultaneously and
                multi-directionally, and to be able to control what is being
                shared. We saw it as a natural extension and closely coupled
                with your OS — instant, fast, and seamless. A better way to pair
                program, debug tough incidents, or jam on great ideas by sharing
                multi-modal information like code, commands, graphs, or logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                All that made a lot of sense conceptually but to be frank, it
                was hard to get it right. Now a part of Datadog and with major
                parts of our app rewritten in Rust, we feel we’re closer than
                ever.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s what pair programmers liked about CoScreen, so we made it
                even better: - High definition code sharing: Windows are
                video-streamed in real-time at their native resolution whenever
                possible. You never have to search for your IDE anymore or be
                anxious to share the wrong window. - Multi-directional
                collaboration: You can share, while Alice shares, while Bob
                shares. Side-by-side, across multiple displays. With built-in
                crisp audio and video chat. - 60FPS+ super smooth mouse
                pointers. Type, click, and draw on any shared window as if it
                was your own.
              </p>
              <p>
                What some of you did NOT like, so we fixed it in CoScreen V5: -
                CPU utilization and latency have been reduced drastically as
                various parts of our desktop client are now implemented in Rust,
                building on crates such as cxx, rust-skia, iced, as well as Neon
                for our native remote control plugins. - No more accidental
                clicking into remote windows through the new remote window
                toggles. - You’re no longer bound by your displays, can share
                windows from multiple of them at the same time and even move
                them across displays while sharing without stopping. - You’ll
                also soon be able to join meetings from your browser from any
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                CoScreen runs on macOS (x64 and Apple Silicon), Windows, soon
                also on the web and is currently free. We’re planning to charge
                for larger teams and enterprise features in the future.
                Hopefully - finally - we’ll also have a Linux version one day.
                Tell us if you need it urgently and if you have any other
                requirements!

              <a href="https://noya.io">https://noya.io</a>), a product design
              tool that lets everyone design like a designer. Here’s a video:
              <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910"
                >https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910</a
              >.
              <p>
                Getting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing
                tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too
                low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other
                hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced
                skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out
                a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to
                make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more
                designers is time-consuming and expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                David and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we
                realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their
                knowledge (e.g. design rules and components) into a tool, then
                let non-designers (PMs, marketing, engineers) use that tool to
                make new screens and features. This helps remove design as a
                bottleneck for a lot of product development. We built such tools
                at Airbnb, and with Noya we’re building them for product teams
                everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Current design tools are too freeform for non-designers to
                design great products. They let you do anything, like draw
                rectangles and move text blocks anywhere, so it's easy to mess
                things up, introduce inconsistencies, and so on. With Noya,
                designers set up "guardrails" in the form of a design system
                (rules and components for a company's design), then
                non-designers work within those constraints. This makes it
                harder to mess up and quicker to build something that fits in
                with your product. Footguns begone!
              </p>
              <p>
                It all starts with wireframing, i.e. drawing a minimal layout
                that shows the elements that would exist on the screen. Noya
                combines wireframes and design systems to generate high-fidelity
                designs and code. If you have an idea for a user interface, you
                can use Noya to quickly wireframe that idea by clicking and
                dragging to place blocks for each element of your user
                interface. For each block, choose a type and provide any content
                that goes inside it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the rules and component library of the design system
                you select, Noya automatically turns your wireframe into a
                high-fidelity design. This design can be exported to design
                files, to Figma or Sketch, or to React code.
              </p>
              <p>
                (If you’re curious what the React code looks like, try exporting
                and take a look! There’s plenty of room for improvement,
                especially around responsive layouts, but we think it’s a
                reasonable starting point. The code export is configurable on a
                per-design-system basis so that it’s closer to a company’s
                preferred standards).
              </p>
              <p>
                Most tools in this space are optimized for either low-fidelity
                wireframes that are quick to create (e.g. Balsamiq), or
                high-fidelity output that’s slow to create (e.g. Figma). We
                think there’s a gap in the market for a great wireframing tool
                that produces a high-fidelity output quickly. For example,
                two-thirds of Figma users are non-designers. While there are
                many valid reasons for a non-designer to use Figma, there’s
                often a lot of upfront effort required to learn the tool and set
                up components. We think there should be a lower-effort way for
                non-designers to create high-fidelity designs.
              </p>

                Based on feedback from our Show HN (<a

                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34848583</a
                >), we’ve improved our onboarding, revamped our entire block
                library, and added a documentation reference for each block
                type. The docs are interactive, so you can play with our editor
                without signing up:

                Startup founders and PMs have used Noya to build landing pages,
                dashboards, and other flows of their apps. We have some
                templates on our site (<a href="https://noya.io/templates"
                  >https://noya.io/templates</a
                >) that give examples of what people commonly build in Noya. We
                use Noya ourselves, and have been surprised by how frustrating
                it was to go back to existing design tools after using even the
                earliest prototypes of Noya. Existing design tools just aren’t
                built for the comprehensive design systems that products are
                based on today.

                supporting other design tool builders just yet, so we haven’t
                published our packages (renderer, canvas, etc) to npm, but we’re
                planning to use the Apache V2 license. We make money by offering
                a paid subscription.

                Noya currently supports one design system based on Chakra UI.
                We’re adding additional design systems soon, including Material
                Design, as well as the ability to import custom design systems.
                If your company has an open source design system and you’re
                interested in trying Noya with it, we may be able to integrate
                your design system for free. Get in touch if you’re interested -

              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love for you to try Noya and let us know what you think!
                It’s still very much an MVP and all kinds of feedback are
                welcome.
