                MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web
                crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products
                including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across
                industries including Recruiting, Finance, Security, Sales, and
                Marketing. The company was founded in 2011 and received
                investment from top-tier investors including Y Combinator and
                Mark Cuban.

                We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20
                countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no
                dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies
                and backgrounds are welcome.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming
                is not just a job but it's something they love to do. We're
                obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases,
                compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does
                this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have
                a fully-automated development environment and be pushing commits
                on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple
                times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Our codebase is
                written in Python, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, Rust, and Nix. To
                start working on our codebase, you'll need to be familiar with
                Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.
              </p>
              <p>
                We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate
                three datacenters with high performance servers we've built that
                are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process.
                We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do
                full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis
                on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are
                published. Unlike a typical company where you'll spend half of
                your time in meetings— at MixRank you'll get to direct your
                entire focus into difficult technical problems that will help
                you to grow as an individual.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't
                singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy
                on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the
                position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom
                role and responsibilities that are specialized to their
                interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of
                specific requirements for a position with the expectation that
                you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be
                the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements
                decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first
                get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then
                we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific
                talents.

              <p>Junior Software Engineer</p>
              <p>
                We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of
                professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity
                exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.
                This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse
                opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases,
                distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis,
                machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data
                mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight
                what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side
                projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ideally you've already finished with school, but if you still
                have one or more years left please feel free to apply anyway. If
                you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to
                accommodate your schedule.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                For the past 3 years, I've been building and iterating on a
                product I called Horizon Pics, which is a file hosting service,
                similar to mainstream services, like Imgur. Horizon allows you
                to quickly upload and store all types of files, from images and
                video, to PDFs and other documents. The biggest differentiating
                factor is that Horizon's incentives are much more aligned with
                you, the end-user.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike Imgur, Horizon has absolutely no ads, doesn't sell your
                data, has built-in security and privacy controls, and is fully
                focused on your file sharing needs. No social media or other
                bloat.
              </p>
              <p>
                This past week, I've launched a rebrand of Horizon which
                features a brand-new desktop app called Alpine[3], which serves
                as a local companion to Horizon. With it comes the capability to
                auto-upload screen captures and upload your clipboards as
                shareable pastes. For extra privacy, clipboard sharing can be
                automatically deleted after one view, or end-to-end encrypted
                with AES-256-GCM client-side. The desktop app is completely free
                to use! It's powered by Tauri using TypeScript, SvelteKit, Sass,
                and Rust.
              </p>
              <p>
                Horizon offers a free plan with limited storage and upload
                sizes, while the paid plan offers higher limits.
              </p>

              I have an older house (1950s) and I'd really like to see behind my
              walls without physically excavating so I can try to run some wires
              without encountering surprise obstructions. There are tools which
              use WifI to do detect humans[1]
              (https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-routers-used-to-detect-human-locations-poses-within-a-room)
              [2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897828) but I'm looking
              for a way to use Wifi for more general imaging. There's a paper
              from 2017 ("Holography of WiFi
              Radiation)[https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.183901]
              and many other scholarly papers about object detection via WiFi,
              but I haven't been able to find any off-the-shelf
              products/projects that would just build a 3D environmental density
              map without any object detection. The resolution doesn't have to
              be great - not looking for millimeter scale features e.g.
              structural weakness. Is there anything out there that comes close?
              Given recent archaeological uses of drone LIDAR and satellite
              tomography, I figure the software for interpreting this kind of
              data should be pretty robust by now, just maybe it hasn't filtered
              down to the consumer market.
