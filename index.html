              >). We make an iPhone app that helps you reduce compulsive phone
              use. It regulates your social media experiences and app usage,
              saving you from impulse opens and mindless scrolls. Here’s a demo:
              <a
                href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXLYvtG1zZ6ZRq01eGc8jlsn70vlUZLj/view"

              <p>
                During the pandemic, we found ourselves spending more and more
                of our lives on digital content. Youtube, Instagram, Twitter,
                even HN were always <i>right</i> there, and the impulse to open
                and consume became stronger than ever. We realized how much of
                our technology use was compulsive rather than intentional.
                Willpower alone was not enough to solve the problem. Most of
                these products have been designed to activate dopamine feedback
                loops and, to be blunt, keep users hooked [1].
              </p>
              <p>
                Not wanting to be addicted, we started cobbling together
                "attention protection stacks": iPhone shortcuts, Chrome
                Extensions, custom /etc/ files, anything to create digital
                environments that aligned with our own goals rather than the
                engagement metrics of big tech. We had some surprising successes
                with that, so we decided to build a comprehensive and
                approachable solution. We began with our worst pain point:
                mindless scrolling on our phones.
              </p>
              <p>
                How it works: you tell us what apps you want to reduce your
                usage of, and we do the following to train better habits:
              </p>
              <p>
                (1) App Intercepts: we inject a mandatory 15 second breathing
                exercise before opening apps you’ve added to Clearspace. This
                helps to break the dopamine feedback loop that your brain has
                learned, where tapping an app icon yields an instant reward.
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) Intentional Sessions: at the end of said breathing exercise,
                you tell us how long you want to use an app for. Then you enter
                and we'll pull you out after that amount of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                (3) Cumulative Progress: each day you stay below your intended
                time limit adds to your streak of successes. Over time,
                protecting your streak frequently becomes more important than a
                "quick scroll" before bed (and if you get a 100 day under-budget
                streak, we'll send you a hat).
              </p>
              <p>
                (4) Teammates: you can add “teammates” who will receive
                automatic texts if you exceed your budget on an app, remove it
                from Clearspace, or delete Clearspace entirely.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may notice how this is fighting fire with fire: we use tech
                to limit your tech use, social features to curtail social media,
                and so on. The mechanisms built into the big apps have such a
                conditioning effect on the brain, they’re nearly impossible for
                most people to resist. We invoke similarly powerful mechanisms
                on <i>your</i> behalf, to help your life be less dominated by
                these things.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of this only recently became technically possible. The new
                ScreenTime API from Apple allows users to connect apps on their
                phone to third party apps (like us). We receive opaque "tokens"
                for each user app selection and we can perform actions on the
                tokens, which affects the apps without us knowing what the
                actual apps are. We can add and remove "shields" to a token,
                which presents an obstructing interface over an app or website.
                We can display a user's usage of a token over a time period and
                display that data to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Btw, after 3M "app intercepts" (a 15 second wait), we’ve found
                that people opt <i>not</i> to continue to the app they tried to
                open 54% of the time. We think that says something about how
                much of our social media use as a society is compulsive rather
                than intentional.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some typical testimonials from users who have been
                recovering their time by using our app:

              <p>
                If you're an iPhone user, we'd love for you to try our app and
                let us know what you think! We have a freemium model: adding one
                app is free, paid tier gives you unlimited apps. Your feedback
                on the app would be deeply appreciated and more broadly we’d
                love to hear about how you’ve navigated this problem in your
                life.

                It can be great if the website somehow ends up in a training
                dataset (who knows), and it can be super helpful for AI website
                crawlers, instead of using thousands of tokens to know what your
                website is about, they can do it with just a few hundred.
