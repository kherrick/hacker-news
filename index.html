              <p>
                It turned out things get messy when your software is running in
                places you can't simply SSH into.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the last year, we’ve also helped modernize a lot of
                home-baked solutions: bash scripts that email when updates fail,
                Excel sheets nobody trusts to track customer versions, engineers
                driving to customer sites to fix things in person, debug
                sessions over email (“can you take a screenshot of the logs and
                send it to me?”), customers with access to internal AWS or GCP
                registries because there was no better option, and deployments
                two major versions behind that nobody wants to touch.
              </p>
              <p>
                We waited a year before making our first breaking change, which
                led to a major SemVer update—but it was eventually necessary. We
                needed to completely rewrite how we manage customer
                organizations. In Distr, we differentiate between vendors and
                customers. A vendor is typically the author of a software / AI
                application that wants to distribute it to customers.
                Previously, we had taken a shortcut where every customer was
                just a single user who owned a deployment. We’ve now introduced
                customer organizations. Vendors onboard customer organizations
                onto the platform, and customers own their internal user
                management, including RBAC. This change obviously broke our API,
                and although the migration for our cloud customers was smooth,
                custom solutions built on top of our APIs needed updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other notable features we’ve implemented since our first launch:
              </p>
              <p>
                - An OCI container registry built on an adapted version of
                <a href="https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/"
                  >https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/</a
                >, directly embedded into our codebase and served via a separate
                port from a single Docker image. This allows vendors to
                distribute Docker images and other OCI artifacts if customers
                want to self-manage deployments.
              </p>
              <p>
                - License Management to restrict which customers can access
                which applications or artifact versions. Although “license
                management” is a broadly used term, the main purpose here is to
                codify contractual agreements between vendors and customers. In
                its simplest form, this is time-based access to specific
                software versions, which vendors can now manage with Distr.

                - Container logs and metrics you can actually see without SSH
                access. Internally, we debated whether to use a time-series
                database or store all logs in Postgres. Although we had to
                tinker quite a bit with Postgres indexes, it now runs stably.

                Distr is now used by 200+ vendors, including Fortune 500
                companies, across on-prem, GovCloud, AWS, and GCP, spanning
                health tech, fintech, security, and AI companies. We’ve also
                started working on our first air-gapped environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Distr 3.0, we’re working on native Terraform / OpenTofu and
                Zarf support to provision and update infrastructure in
                customers’ cloud accounts and physical environments—empowering
                vendors to offer BYOC and air-gapped use cases, all from a
                single platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distr is fully open source and self-hostable:

              <p>
                I live in the CLI, but for discovery and ongoing monitoring, I
                kept bouncing between tools, terminals, and mental context
                switches. I wanted something faster and more visual, without
                losing technical depth — so I built a GUI that brings my
                favorite diagnostics together in one place.
              </p>
              <p>
                About three months ago, I shared an early version here and got a
                ton of great feedback. I listened: a new name (it was
                PingStalker), a longer trial, and a lot of new features. Today
                I’m excited to share NetViews 2.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                NetViews started because I wanted to know if something on the
                network was scanning my machine. Once I had that, I wanted quick
                access to core details—external IP, Wi-Fi data, and local
                topology. Then I wanted more: fast, reliable scans using ARP
                tables and ICMP.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a Wi-Fi engineer, I couldn’t stop there. I kept adding ways
                to surface what’s actually going on behind the scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Discovery &amp; Scanning: * ARP, ICMP, mDNS, and DNS discovery
                to enumerate every device on your subnet (IP, MAC, vendor, open
                ports). * Fast scans using ARP tables first, then ICMP, to avoid
                the usual “nmap wait”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wireless Visibility: * Detailed Wi-Fi connection performance and
                signal data. * Visual and audible tools to quickly locate the
                access point you’re associated with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Monitoring &amp; Timelines: * Connection and ping timelines over
                1, 2, 4, or 8 hours. * Continuous “live ping” monitoring to
                visualize latency spikes, packet loss, and reconnects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Low-level Traffic (but only what matters): * Live capture of
                DHCP, ARP, 802.1X, LLDP/CDP, ICMP, and off-subnet chatter. *
                mDNS decoded into human-readable output (this took months of
                deep dives).
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, it’s written in Swift. It uses low-level BSD
                sockets for ICMP and ARP, Apple’s Network framework for
                interface enumeration, and selectively wraps existing
                command-line tools where they’re still the best option. The
                focus has been on speed and low overhead.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d love feedback from anyone who builds or uses network
                diagnostic tools: - Does this fill a gap you’ve personally hit
                on macOS? - Are there better approaches to scan speed or event
                visualization that you’ve used? - What diagnostics do you still
                find yourself dropping to the CLI for?
              </p>

              <p>
                Basically, there's a JIT "compiler" embedded into a framework
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach has been used by ajv and TypeBox before for input
                validation, making it faster than other competitors
              </p>
              <p>
                Elysia basically does the same, but scales that into a full
                backend framework
              </p>
              <p>
                This gave Elysia an unfair advantage in the performance game,
                making Elysia the fastest framework on Bun runtime, but also
                faster than most on Node, Deno, and Cloudflare Worker as well,
                when using the same underlying HTTP adapter
              </p>
              <p>
                There is an escape hatch if necessary, but for the past 3 years,
                there have been no critical reports about the JIT "compiler"
              </p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>
