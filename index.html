                MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web
                crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products
                including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across
                industries including Recruiting, Finance, Security, Sales, and
                Marketing.

                Our team is 42 full-time, full-remote from 20+ countries. We're
                growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside
                funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are
                welcome.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming
                is not just a job but it's something they love to do. We're
                obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases,
                compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does
                this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have
                a (fully-automated) development environment and be pushing
                commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen
                multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Our
                codebase is written in Python, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, Rust,
                and Nix. The basic technologies you'll need to be productive are
                Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.
              </p>
              <p>
                We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate
                two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that
                are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process.
                We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do
                full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis
                on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are
                published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of
                your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira
                tickets— at MixRank you'll get to direct your entire focus into
                difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an
                individual.

              <p>
                Ideally you've already finished with school, but if you still

                A while back, I wrote a templating engine (MIT License), which I
                mostly use for small side projects, either static or ssr
                generated. Simplicity is one of the main goals.

              <p>
                A few years ago my brother in-law was looking to purchase his
                first car. He was struggling to know what to look for when going
                to car dealerships and felt quite overwhelmed with the financial
                and practical decisions required. Not that I have any particular
                expertise with cars or the engineering involved, but through my
                own experiences purchasing cars and owning them I gave him some
                advice and "tips". As anyone would.
              </p>
              <p>
                Things only morphed from there, I spent the next couple of years
                in my spare time learning to code, researching, and developing
                CarCheck. It's been a journey! Hindsight is 20/20 and some
                things I would have done differently, but that's part of the
                fun. I am proud to be sharing my (imperfect) first app with the
                world and excited to learn from you all for my next project :)
              </p>
              <p>I would love to hear your feedback!</p>

                I went, and I put together 3 quality of life snippets I use all
                the time and put it in a single makext.mk file that can be
                included in other Makefiles and wrote a basic readme for it.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not meant to be a replacement for other task runners,
                but I do think it can be useful to some of you.
