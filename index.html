                Since our launch ten months ago, my cofounder and I have
                continued to improve our music model significantly. You can

                here <a href="https://sonauto.ai/">https://sonauto.ai/</a> ,

                However, given there are only two of us right now competing in
                the "best model and average user UI" race we haven't had the
                time to build some of the really neat ideas our users and pro
                musicians have been dreaming up (e..g, DAW plugins, live
                performance transition generators, etc). The hacker musician
                community has a rich history of taking new tech and doing really
                cool and unexpected stuff with it, too.
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, we're opening up an API that gives full access to the
                features of our underlying diffusion model (e.g., generation,
                inpainting, extensions, transition generation, inverse
                sampling). Here are some things our early test users are already
                doing with it:
              </p>
              <p>
                - A cool singing-to-video model by our friends at Lemon Slice:

                >)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Open source wrapper written by one of our musician users:

              </p>
              <p>
                - You can also play with all the API features via our consumer

              <p>
                - Generate a rock song:

                - Download two songs from YouTube (e.g., Smash Mouth to Rick
                Astley) and generate a transition between them:

              </p>
              <p>
                - Generate a singing telegram video (powered by ours and also
                Lemon Slice's API):

                We'd love to hear what you think, and are open to answering any
                tech questions about our model too! It's still a latent
                diffusion model, but much larger and with a much better GAN
                decoder.

              <p>There’s 2 parts to this:</p>
              <p>
                1. An agents.json file describes how to link API calls together
                into outcome-based tools for LLMs. This file sits alongside an
                OpenAPI file.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. The agents.json SDK loads agents.json files as tools for an
                LLM that can then be executed as a series of API calls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why is this worth building? Developers are realizing that to use
                tools with their LLMs in a stateless way, they have to implement
                an API manually to work with LLMs. We see devs sacrifice
                agentic, non-deterministic behavior for hard-coded workflows to
                create outcomes that can work. agents.json lets LLMs be
                non-deterministic for the outcomes they want to achieve and
                deterministic for the API calls it takes to get there.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve put together some real examples if you're curious what the
                final output looks like. Under the hood, these LLMs have the
                same system prompt and we plug in a different agents.json to
                give access to different APIs. It’s all templatized.

                We really wanted to solve real production use cases, and knew
                this couldn’t just be a proxy. Our approach allows you to make
                API calls from your own infrastructure. The open-source
                specification + runner package make this paradigm possible.
                Agents.json is truly stateless; the client manages all
                memory/state and it can be deployed on existing infra like
                serverless environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might be wondering - <i>isn’t OpenAPI enough?</i> Why can’t
                I just put that in the LLM’s context?
              </p>
              <p>
                We thought so too, at first, when building an agent with access
                to Gmail. But putting the API spec into LLM context gave us poor
                accuracy in tool selection and in tool calling. Even with
                cutting down our output space to 5-10 endpoints, we’d see the
                LLMs fail to select the right tool. We wanted the LLM to just
                work given an outcome rather than having it reason each time
                which series of API calls to make.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Gmail API, for example, has endpoints to search for threads,
                list the emails in a thread, and reply with an email given
                base64 RFC 822 content. All that has to happen in order with the
                right arguments for our agent to reply to a thread. We found
                that APIs are designed for developers, not for LLMs.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we implemented agents.json. It started off as a config file
                we were using internally that we slowly started adding features
                to like auth registration, tool search, and multiple API
                sources. 3 weeks ago, Dharmesh (CTO of Hubspot) posted about the
                concept of a specification that could translate APIs for LLMs.
                It sounded a lot like what we already had working internally and
                we decided to make it open source. We built agents.json for
                ourselves but we’re excited to share it.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the weeks since we’ve put it out there, agents.json has 10
                vetted API integrations (some of them official) and more are
                being added every day. We recently made the tool search and
                custom collection platform free for everyone so it’s even easier
                for devs to scale the number of tools. (<a

                Please tell us what you think! Especially if you’re building
                agents or creating APIs!

                My latest side project is knowledge graph that maps the French
                culinary network using data extracted from restaurant reviews
                from LeFooding.com. The project uses LLMs to extract structured
                information from unstructured text.
              </p>
              <p>Some technical aspects you may be interested in:</p>
              <p>
                - Used structured generation to reliably parse unstructured text
                into a consistent schema
              </p>
              <p>
                - Tested multiple models (Mistral-7B-v0.3, Llama3.2-3B,
                gpt4o-mini) for information extraction
              </p>
              <p>
                - Created an interactive visualization using gephi-lite and
                Retina (WebGL)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Built (with Claude) a simple Flask web app to clean and
                deduplicate the data
              </p>
              <p>
                - Total cost for inferencing 2000 reviews with gpt4o-mini: less
                than 1€!
              </p>
