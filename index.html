              <p>
                Google DeepMind and their new startup Isomorphic Labs, are
                expanding into drug discovery. They developed AlphaFold3 as
                their model to accelerate drug discovery and create demand from
                big pharma. They already signed Novartis and Eli Lilly for $3
                billion - Google’s becoming a pharma company! (<a
                  href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kicks-off-2024-with-two-pharmaceutical-collaborations"
                  >https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kick...</a
                >)
              </p>
              <p>
                AlphaFold3 is a biomolecular structure prediction model that can
                do three main things: (1) Predict the structure of proteins; (2)
                Predict the structure of drug-protein interactions; (3) Predict
                nucleic acid - protein complex structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                AlphaFold3 is incredibly important for science because it vastly
                accelerates the mapping of protein structures. It takes one PhD
                student their entire PhD to do one structure. With AlphaFold3,
                you get a prediction in minutes on par with experimental
                accuracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                There’s just one problem: when DeepMind published AlphaFold3 in
                May (<a
                  href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w"
                  >https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w</a
                >), there was no code. This brought up questions about
                reproducibility (<a
                  href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01463-0"
                  >https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01463-0</a
                >) as well as complaints from the scientific community (<a
                  href="https://undark.org/2024/06/06/opinion-alphafold-3-open-source/"
                  >https://undark.org/2024/06/06/opinion-alphafold-3-open-sourc...</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                AlphaFold3 is a fundamental advance in structure modeling
                technology that the entire biotech industry deserves to be able
                to reap the benefits from. Its applications are vast, including:
              </p>
              <p>
                - CRISPR gene editing technologies, where scientists can see
                exactly how the DNA interacts with the scissor Cas protein;
              </p>
              <p>
                - Cancer research - predicting how a potential drug binds to the
                cancer target. One of the highlights in DeepMind’s paper is the
                prediction of a clinical KRAS inhibitor in complex with its
                target.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Antibody / nanobody to target predictions. AlphaFold3 improves
                accuracy on this class of molecules 2 fold compared to the next
                best tool.
              </p>
              <p>

                Today we are releasing the full model trained on single chain
                proteins (capability 1 above), with the other two capabilities
                to be trained and released soon. We also include the training
                code. Weights will be released once training and benchmarking is
                complete. We wanted this to be truly open source so we used the
                Apache 2.0 license.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deepmind published the full structure of the model, along with
                each components’ pseudocode in their paper. We translated this
                fully into PyTorch, which required more reverse engineering than
                we thought!
              </p>
              <p>
                When building the initial version, we discovered multiple issues
                in DeepMind’s paper that would interfere with the training - we
                think the deep learning community might find these especially
                interesting. (Diffusion folks, we would love feedback on this!)
                These include:
              </p>
              <p>
                - MSE loss scaling differs from Karras et al. (2022). The
                weighting provided in the paper does not downweigh the loss at
                high noise levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Omission of residual layers in the paper - we add these back
                and see benefits in gradient flow and convergence. Anyone have
                any idea why Deepmind may have omitted the residual connections
                in the DiT blocks?
              </p>
              <p>
                - The MSA module, in its current form, has dead layers. The last
                pair weighted averaging and transition layers cannot contribute
                to the pair representation, hence no grads. We swap the order to
                the one in the ExtraMsaStack in AlphaFold2. An alternative
                solution would be to use weight sharing, but whether this is
                done is ambiguous in the paper.
              </p>

              <p>
                How this came about: we are building Ligo (YC S24), where we are
                using ideas from AlphaFold3 for enzyme design. We thought open
                sourcing it was a nice side quest to benefit the community.

              <a href="https://mem0.ai">https://mem0.ai</a>). Mem0 adds a
              stateful memory layer to AI applications, allowing them to
              remember user interactions, preferences, and context over time.
              This enables AI apps to deliver increasingly personalized and
              intelligent experiences that evolve with every interaction.
              There’s a demo video at
              <a href="https://youtu.be/VtRuBCTZL1o"
                >https://youtu.be/VtRuBCTZL1o</a

              and a playground to try out at
              <a href="https://app.mem0.ai/playground"
                >https://app.mem0.ai/playground</a
              >. You'll need to sign up to use the playground – this helps
              ensure responses are more tailored to you by associating
              interactions with an individual profile.
              <p>
                Current LLMs are stateless—they forget everything between
                sessions. This limitation leads to repetitive interactions, a
                lack of personalization, and increased computational costs
                because developers must repeatedly include extensive context in
                every prompt.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we were building Embedchain (an open-source RAG framework
                with over 2M downloads), users constantly shared their
                frustration with LLMs’ inability to remember anything between
                sessions. They had to repeatedly input the same context, which
                was costly and inefficient. We realized that for AI to deliver
                more useful and intelligent responses, it needed memory. That’s
                when we started building Mem0.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mem0 employs a hybrid datastore architecture that combines
                graph, vector, and key-value stores to store and manage memories
                effectively. Here is how it works:
              </p>
              <p>
                Adding memories: When you use mem0 with your AI App, it can take
                in any messages or interactions and automatically detects the
                important parts to remember.
              </p>
              <p>
                Organizing information: Mem0 sorts this information into
                different categories: - Facts and structured data go into a
                key-value store for quick access. - Connections between things
                (like people, places, or objects) are saved in a graph store
                that understands relationships between different entities. - The
                overall meaning and context of conversations are stored in a
                vector store that allows for finding similar memories later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Retrieving memories: When given an input query, Mem0 searches
                for and retrieves related stored information by leveraging a
                combination of graph traversal techniques, vector similarity and
                key-value lookups. It prioritizes the most important, relevant,
                and recent information, making sure the AI always has the right
                context, no matter how much memory is stored.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike traditional AI applications that operate without memory,
                Mem0 introduces a continuously learning memory layer. This
                reduces the need to repeatedly include long blocks of context in
                every prompt, which lowers computational costs and speeds up
                response times. As Mem0 learns and retains information over
                time, AI applications become more adaptive and provide more
                relevant responses without relying on large context windows in
                each interaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve open-sourced the core technology that powers
                Mem0—specifically the memory management functionality in the
                vector and graph databases, as well as the stateful memory
                layer—under the Apache 2.0 license. This includes the ability to
                add, organize, and retrieve memories within your AI
                applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, certain features that are optimized for production use,
                such as low latency inference, and the scalable graph and vector
                datastore for real-time memory updates, are part of our paid
                platform. These advanced capabilities are not part of the
                open-source package but are available for those who need to
                scale memory management in production environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve made both our open-source version and platform available
                for HN users. You can check out our GitHub repo (<a

              <p>
                Graphiti helps you create and query graphs that evolve over
                time. Knowledge Graphs have been explored extensively for
                information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability
                to build a knowledge graph while handling changing relationships
                and maintaining historical context.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Zep, we build a memory layer for LLM applications. Developers
                use Zep to recall relevant user information from past
                conversations without including the entire chat history in a
                prompt. Accurate context is crucial for LLM applications. If an
                AI agent doesn't remember that you've changed jobs or confuses
                the chronology of events, its responses can be jarring or
                irrelevant, or worse, inaccurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before Graphiti, our approach to storing and retrieving user
                “memory” was, in effect, a specialized RAG pipeline. An LLM
                extracted “facts” from a user’s chat history. Semantic search,
                reranking, and other techniques then surfaced facts relevant to
                the current conversation back to a developer for inclusion in
                their prompt.
              </p>
              <p>
                We attempted to reconcile how new information may change our
                understanding of existing facts:
              </p>
              <p>Fact: “Kendra loves Adidas shoes”</p>
              <p>
                User message: “I’m so angry! My favorite Adidas shoes fell
                apart! Puma’s are my new favorite shoes!”
              </p>
              <p>Facts:</p>
              <p>- “Kendra used to love Adidas shoes but now prefers Puma.”</p>
              <p>- “Kendra’s Adidas shoes fell apart.”</p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, this approach became problematic. Reconciling
                facts from increasingly complex conversations challenged even
                frontier LLMs such as gpt-4o. We saw incomplete facts, poor
                recall, and hallucinations. Our RAG search also failed at times
                to capture the nuanced relationships between facts, leading to
                irrelevant or contradictory information being retrieved.
              </p>
              <p>
                We tried fixing these issues with prompt optimization but saw
                diminishing returns on effort. We realized that a graph would
                help model a user’s complex world, potentially addressing these
                challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                We were intrigued by Microsoft’s GraphRAG, which expanded on RAG
                text chunking with a graph to better model a document corpus.
                However, it didn't solve our core problem: GraphRAG is designed
                for static documents and doesn't natively handle temporality.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, we built Graphiti, which is designed from the ground up to
                handle constantly changing information, hybrid semantic and
                graph search, and scale:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Temporal Awareness: Tracks changes in facts and relationships
                over time. Graph edges include temporal metadata to record
                relationship lifecycles.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Episodic Processing: Ingests data as discrete episodes,
                maintaining data provenance and enabling incremental processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Hybrid Search: Semantic and BM25 full-text search, with the
                ability to rerank results by distance from a central node.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Scalable: Designed for large datasets, parallelizing LLM calls
                for batch processing while preserving event chronology.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Varied Sources: Ingests both unstructured text and structured
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Graphiti has significantly improved our ability to maintain
                accurate user context. It does a far better job of fact
                reconciliation over long, complex conversations. Node distance
                reranking, which places a user at the center of the graph, has
                also been a valuable tool. Quantitative data evaluation results
                may be a future ShowHN.
              </p>
              <p>Work is ongoing, including:</p>
              <p>
                1. Improving support for faster and cheaper small language
                models.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Exploring fine-tuning to improve accuracy and reduce latency.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Adding new querying capabilities, including search over
                neighborhood (sub-graph) summaries.
              </p>
