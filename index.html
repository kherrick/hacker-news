                We built Sgai to experiment with a different model of
                AI-assisted development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of prompting step-by-step, you define an outcome in
                GOAL.md (what should be built, not how), and Sgai runs a
                coordinated set of AI agents to execute it.
              </p>
              <p>
                - It decomposes the goal into a DAG of roles (developer →
                reviewer → safety analyst, etc.) - It asks clarifying questions
                when needed - It writes code, runs tests, and iterates -
                Completion gates (e.g. make test) determine when it's actually
                done
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything runs locally in your repo. There’s a web dashboard
                showing real-time execution of the agent graph. Nothing
                auto-pushes to GitHub.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve used it internally for prototyping small apps and internal
                tooling. It’s still early and rough in places, but functional
                enough to share.
              </p>

                Curious what people think about DAG-based multi-agent workflows
                for coding. Has anyone here experimented with similar
                approaches?

              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve grouped these under a single umbrella: Django Control Room.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea is pretty simple: the Django admin already gives you
                authentication, permissions, and a familiar interface. It can
                also act as an operational layer for your app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each panel is just a small Django app with a simple interface,
                so it’s easy to build your own and plug it in.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m working on more panels (signals, errors, etc.) and also
                thinking about how far this pattern can go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Curious how others think about this. Does it make sense to
                consolidate this kind of tooling inside the admin, or do you
                prefer keeping it separate?

              We build an AI agent that plans company events from start to
              finish entirely through conversation. Similar to how Lovable helps
              build websites through chat, we apply that approach to event
              planning. Our system handles venue sourcing, vendor coordination,
              flight cost estimation, itinerary building, and overall project
              management.
              <p>
                Here’s a demo:

                and does not require signup.
              </p>
              <p>
                We went through YC in 2022 but did not launch on HN at the time.
                Back then, the product was more traditional, closer to an
                Airbnb-style search marketplace. Over the past two years, after
                helping organize more than 1,200 events, we rebuilt the core
                system around an agent architecture that directly manages the
                planning process. With this new version live, it felt like the
                right moment to share it here since it represents a
                fundamentally different approach to planning events.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem: Planning a company retreat usually means choosing
                between three imperfect options: (1) Hire an event planner and
                pay significant fees and venue markups; (2) Do it yourself and
                spend dozens of hours on research, emails, and negotiation; or
                (3) Use tools like Airbnb that are not designed for group
                logistics or meeting space.
              </p>
              <p>
                The difficulty is not just finding a venue. Even for 30 to 50
                people, planning turns into weeks of back-and-forth emails for
                quotes, comparing inconsistent pricing across PDFs, and tracking
                budgets in spreadsheets. It becomes an ongoing coordination
                problem with evolving constraints and slow, asynchronous vendor
                responses. Most existing software is form-driven, but the real
                workflow is conversational and stateful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Offsites are expensive and high stakes. A single event can
                represent a significant chunk of a team’s annual budget, and
                mistakes show up directly as cost overruns or poor experiences.
                Founders and operators often end up spending time on event
                logistics instead of their actual work.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ran into this while organizing retreats at a previous company.
                Before TeamOut, I worked as an AI researcher at IBM on NLP and
                machine learning systems. Sitting inside long email threads and
                cost spreadsheets, it did not look like a marketplace gap to me.
                It looked like a reasoning and state management problem. As
                large language models improved at multi-step reasoning and tool
                use, it became realistic to automate the coordination layer
                itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Solution: The core agent relies on a combination of models
                such as Gemini, Claude, and GPT. A central LLM-based agent
                maintains planning context across turns and decides which
                specialized tool to call next. Each tool has a specific
                responsibility: - Venue search and filtering - Cost estimations
                (accommodation + flights) - Budget comparisons - Quote and
                outreach flows - Communication tool with our team
              </p>
              <p>
                For venue recommendations across more than 10,000 venues, we do
                not rely purely on the language model. We embed both user
                requirements and venues into vector representations and retrieve
                candidates using similarity search. Hard constraints such as
                capacity and dates are applied first, and results are ranked
                before being presented.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the interface side, we use a split layout: conversation on
                the left and structured results on the right. As you refine the
                plan in chat, the event updates in real time, allowing an
                iterative workflow rather than a static search experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                What is different is that we treat event planning as a stateful
                coordination problem rather than a one-shot search query. The
                agent orchestrates tools, manages evolving constraints, and
                surfaces trade-offs explicitly. It does not invent venues or
                fabricate pricing, and it is not designed to replace human
                planners for very large or highly customized events.
              </p>
              <p>
                We make money from commissions on venue bookings. It is free for
                teams to explore options and plan. If you’ve organized an
                offsite or large meetup before, I’d genuinely value your
                perspective. Where would you expect this to fail? What edge
                cases are we underestimating? Where wouldn’t you trust an agent
                to handle the details?
              </p>
              <p>
                My engineering team and I will be here all day to answer
                questions, happy to go deep on architecture, tradeoffs, and
                lessons learned. We’d really appreciate your candid feedback.

                Because of this, I wanted to create a game environment that put
                this generation of frontier LLMs' top skill, coding, on full
                display.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ten years ago, a team released a game called Screeps. It was
                described as an "MMO RTS sandbox for programmers." The Screeps
                paradigm of writing code and having it executed in a real-time
                game environment is well suited to LLMs. Drawing on a version of
                the Screeps open source API, LLM Skirmish pits LLMs head-to-head
                in a series of 1v1 real-time strategy games.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my testing I found that Claude Opus 4.5 was the most dominant
                model, but it showed weakness in round 1 as it was overly
                focused on its in-game economy. Meanwhile, I probably spent a
                third of all code on sandbox hardening because GPT 5.2 kept
                trying to cheat by pre-reading its opponent's strategies.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there's interest, I'm planning on doing a round of testing
                with the latest generation of LLMs (Claude 4.6 Opus, GPT 5.3
                Codex, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can run local matches via CLI. I'm running a hosted match
                runner with Google Cloud Run that uses isolated-vm. The match
                playback visualizer is statically served from Cloudflare.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've created a community ladder that you can submit strategies
                to via CLI, no auth required. I've found that the CLI plus the
                skill.md that's available has been enough for AI agents to
                immediately get started.

              I wanted to share our new speech to text model, and the library to
              use them effectively. We're a small startup (six people, sub-$100k
              monthly GPU budget) so I'm proud of the work the team has done to
              create streaming STT models with lower word-error rates than
              OpenAI's largest Whisper model. Admittedly Large v3 is a couple of
              years old, but we're near the top the HF OpenASR leaderboard, even
              up against Nvidia's Parakeet family. Anyway, I'd love to get
              feedback on the models and software, and hear about what people
              might build with it.
