              <p>
                We’ve always made videos to communicate any concept and felt
                like it was the clearest way to communicate. But making good
                videos was time-consuming and tedious. It required planning,
                scripting, recording, editing, syncing voice with visuals. Even
                a 2-minute video could take hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI video tools are impressive at generating cinematic scenes and
                flashy content, but struggle to explain a product demo, walk
                through a complex workflow, or teach a technical topic. People
                still spend hours making explainer videos manually because
                existing AI tools aren’t built for learning or clarity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our solution is Golpo. Our video generation engine generates
                time-aligned graphics with spoken narration that are good for
                onboarding, training, product walkthroughs, and education. It’s
                fast, scalable, and built from the ground up to help people
                understand complex ideas through simple storytelling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a demo:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_LGM0dEyDA#t=7"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_LGM0dEyDA#t=7</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Golpo is built specifically for use cases involving explaining,
                learning, and onboarding. In our (obviously biased!) opinion, it
                feels authentic and engaging in a way no other AI video
                generator does.
              </p>
              <p>
                Golpo can generate videos in over 190 languages. After it
                generates a video, you can fully customize its animations by
                just describing the changes you want to see in each motion
                graphic it generates in natural language.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was challenging to get this to work! Initially, we used a
                code-generation approach with Manim, where we fine-tuned a
                language model to emit Python animation scripts directly from
                the input text. While promising for small examples, this quickly
                became brittle, and the generated code usually contained broken
                imports, unsupported transforms, and poor timing alignment
                between narration and visuals. Debugging and regenerating these
                scripts was often slower than creating them manually.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also explored training a custom diffusion-based video model,
                but found it impractical for our needs. Diffusion could produce
                high-fidelity cinematic scenes, but generating coherent
                sequences beyond about 30 seconds was unreliable without complex
                stitching, making edits required regenerating large portions of
                the video, and visuals frequently drifted from the instructional
                intent, especially for abstract or technical topics. Also, we
                did not have the compute to scale this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Existing state-of-the-art systems like Sora and Veo 3 face
                similar limitations: they are optimized for cinematic
                storytelling, not step-by-step educational content, and they
                lack both the deterministic control needed for time-aligned
                narration and the scalability for 5–10 minute explainers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end, we took a different path of training a reinforcement
                learning agent to “draw” whiteboard strokes, step-by-step,
                optimized for clear, human-like explanations. This worked well
                because the action space was simple and the environment was not
                overly complex, allowing the agent to learn efficient, precise,
                and consistent drawing behaviors.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I'm Adriano, one of the makers of Vaultrice. I'm excited (and a
                little nervous!) to share what we've been building.
              </p>
              <p>
                For years, we found ourselves in a frustrating loop: whenever we
                needed a simple real-time feature—like a "who's online" list, a
                collaborative app, or just sharing state between a marketing
                site and our main app — we'd end up spending days setting up the
                same stack or discarded to do it. Setting it up, it always
                involved wiring together a database, a WebSocket server, an API,
                and managing the connection state. It felt like massive overkill
                for what we were trying to achieve.
              </p>
              <p>
                We wanted a tool that felt as simple to use as the browser's
                `localStorage` API but worked across domains and devices, with
                real-time sync and security built-in.
              </p>
              <p>So, we built Vaultrice.</p>
              <p>
                It’s a key-value data store built on top of Cloudflare's Durable
                Objects, which gives you a strongly consistent backend for each
                data object. You interact with it through our TS/JS SDK, which
                comes in two flavors:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. `NonLocalStorage`: A low-level client with a
                `localStorage`-like API (`setItem`, `getItem`, etc.) plus
                real-time events and presence (`.on()`, `.join()`).
              </p>
              <p>
                2. `SyncObject`: A higher-level, reactive JavaScript Proxy. You
                just change a property on an object (`doc.title = 'New Title'`),
                and it automatically syncs to all other connected clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal is to let you build the real-time features you want in
                minutes, not days. We've also put a lot of thought into a
                layered security model, allowing you to go from simple API key
                restrictions all the way to server-signed object IDs and
                client-side E2EE.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve just launched and would be grateful for any feedback from
                the HN community. What do you think of the API design? Are there
                use cases we haven't considered? Any thoughts on the security
                model?
              </p>
              <p>
                We'll be here (or via email (support@vaultrice.com)) to answer
                any questions. Thanks for checking it out!

              <p>
                A $160M-funded company named Deepki (Trademark 1751952) came
                along and filed for cancellation at EUIPO since they needed the
                trademark now after getting lots of funding. They won. Now my
                trademark is gone.
              </p>
              <p>
                The frustrating part? The EU actually does allow open-source
                (even free projects) to have trademarks, but you have to prove
                "genuine use" in the EU for the goods/services your trademark
                covers. Which seems to force you in collecting user sensitive
                data otherwise you are entirely unable to prove that you have
                actual users in the EU. I generally try to collect as little
                information as possible (also because I don't care where my
                users are coming from). I had google analytics running for some
                time on the main page (not documentation), but most of the time
                it didn't work and it seems most of my users block it anyway.
              </p>
              <p>Here's what I gave the EUIPO and why they said no:</p>
              <p>
                - Google Analytics for my site with a full country breakdown
                from 2018–2023. A few hundred to ~1,800 EU visitors per year per
                country. They said that’s "too small" to count as real
                commercial exploitation for my Class 9 software. Also, they said
                they couldn’t tell which goods those visits were actually for.
              </p>
              <p>
                - npmjs + GitHub stats - hundreds of thousands of downloads and
                thousands of stars. Rejected because there's no location data,
                so they couldn't confirm if the usage was in the EU. In some
                cases, they said the timeframes weren't even clear.
              </p>
              <p>
                - They basically kept repeating that they couldn't clearly link
                any of the usage to the specific goods/services my trademark was
                registered for.
              </p>
              <p>The conclusion:</p>
              <p>
                &gt;Conclusion: It follows from the above that the EUTM
                proprietor has not proven genuine use of the contested mark for
                any of the goods and services for which it is registered. As a
                result, the application for revocation is wholly successful and
                the contested European Union trade mark must be revoked in its
                entirety. According to Article 62(1) EUTMR, the revocation will
                take effect from the date of the application for revocation,
                that is, as of 18/03/2024.
              </p>
              <p>
                &gt;COSTS: According to Article 109(1) EUTMR, the losing party
                in cancellation proceedings must bear fees and costs incurred by
                the other party.
              </p>
              <p>
                They even admitted there's no strict minimum for usage, and free
                software can count, but in their eyes my EU traffic was too low
                and not clearly tied to the trademarked goods.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also have the US trademark for the name. This same company
                tried to register in the US around 2022 (Trademark #79379273)
                and got blocked because it was too similar (decision made by
                USPTO). But a few months ago they somehow got it registered
                there too (Trademark #7789522), not sure how they did that now.
              </p>
              <p>Now I'm sitting here wondering:</p>
              <p>
                - Is it even worth getting a second opinion and appealing in the
                EU? I mean the project is very small.
              </p>
              <p>- Should I fight the US registration?</p>
              <p>
                - Or should I just walk away from trademarks altogether for my
                open-source projects. I lost so much money because of this
                already.
              </p>
              <p>
                - And for OSS projects in general, is there even a practical,
                privacy-friendly way to prove EU usage without generating
                revenue?
              </p>
              <p>
                - Is it even worth holding the trademark if proving EU usage is
                this brittle for OSS? If the trademark can be deleted just like
                that even after spending a few thousands dollars on lawyers.
                Probably a skill issue, but still, damn.
              </p>
              <p>
                It sucks to lose the name I've been building for years to a
                corporation with $160M behind them, especially when this is just
                a side project I do in my spare time, and to them I'm a nobody.
                If nothing else, maybe my case can be a cautionary tale for
                other OSS maintainers.

              <p>
                How it works: You can replace a raw camera feed with the
                filtered stream in your app. The filter processes a live video
                stream, applies privacy protections, and outputs a
                privacy-compliant stream in real time. You can use this
                processed stream for AI apps, social apps, or anything else.
              </p>
              <p>
                Features: Currently, the filter blurs all faces except those who
                have given consent. Consent can be granted verbally by saying
                something like "I consent to be captured" to the camera. I'll be
                adding more features, such as detecting and redacting other
                private information, speech anonymization, and automatic video
                shut-off in certain locations or situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why I built it: While developing an always-on AI
                assistant/memory for glasses, I realized privacy concerns would
                be a critical problem, for both bystanders and the wearer.
                Addressing this involves complex issues like GDPR, CCPA, data
                deletion requests, and consent management, so I built this
                privacy layer first for myself and other developers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reference app: There's a sample app (./examples/rewind/) that
                uses the filter. The demo video is in the README, please check
                it out! The app shows the current camera stream and past
                recordings, both privacy-protected, and will include AI features
                using the recordings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tech: Runs offline on a laptop. Built with FFmpeg (stream
                decode/encode), OpenCV (face recognition/blurring), Faster
                Whisper (voice transcription), and Phi-3.1 Mini (LLM for
                transcription analysis).
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd love feedback and ideas for tackling the privacy challenges
                in wearable camera apps!
