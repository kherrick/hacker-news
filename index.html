              This is a D&amp;amp;D map making tool I've been working on for a
              while now, but I just added some new features to the beta that I
              think HN users might find neat. When building a world map, you can
              use "Dynamic Brushes" to draw organic looking terrain. This is
              achieved entirely with svg filters and javascript canvas, no fancy
              libraries or anything. This came with a pretty large rewrite of
              some of the underlying code, so I'm sure there's a number of bugs
              I haven't come across, but I'd love to hear your opinions on it!

              and thought we'd return home to announce something special and
              hopefully exciting :) We are trying to finally live up to the
              "API" in our name with Zapier's first universal API:
              <p>
                Natural Language Actions –
                <a href="https://zapier.com/l/natural-language-actions"
                  >https://zapier.com/l/natural-language-actions</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                API docs –
                <a href="https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/docs"
                  >https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/docs</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                (to be fair, we have published APIs before that can access
                Zapier data, but never before one devs can use to directly call
                the 5k+ apps / 20k+ actions on our platform)
              </p>
              <p>For example, you can use the API to:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  * Send messages in Slack
  * Retrieve a row in a Google Sheet
  * Draft a reply in Gmail
  * ... and thousands more actions with one universal API
</code></pre>
              We optimized NLA for use cases that receive user input in natural
              language (think chatbots, assistants, or any product/feature using
              LLMs) -- but not strictly required!
              <p>
                Folks have asked for an API for 10 years and I've always been
                slightly embarrassed we didn't have one. We hesitated because we
                did not want to pass along our universe of complexity to end
                devs. With the help of LLMs we found some cool patterns to
                deliver the API we always wanted.
              </p>
              <p>
                My co-founder/CTO Bryan did an interview with Garry on YC blog
                with more details:
                <a

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We also published a LangChain integration to show off some
                possibilities:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  * Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEK_9wLYEHU
  * Jupyter notebook: https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/docs/modules/utils/examples/zapier.ipynb
</code></pre>
              We know the API is not perfect but we're excited and eager for
              feedback to help shape it.

              <p>Today I'd like to share my open source project, Moonshine!</p>
              <p>
                Pretrained vision models are a popular way to reduce how much
                data you need and to speed up training, but for remote sensing
                (i.e. aerial, satellite) it can be a challenge to find good
                weights. Why use Moonshine?
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Pretrained on multispectral data: Existing popular CV
                packages are nice to use but are trained on ImageNet or similar,
                meaning that not only is the domain of the pretraining
                different, but you may be restricted to only 3 channels. For
                remote sensing platforms with multispectral data, this might be
                a non-starter. Moonshine includes models specifically trained
                for your remote sensing problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Focus on usability: There are academic releases of
                specialized models that do support remote sensing data, but
                often they are difficult to use. They might be hard to install,
                and often are supported by a grad student who is more focused on
                publication than software. A core tenant of Moonshine is that it
                should be easy to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've been working on this project for nearly a year now and I'm
                really excited to show it off and most importantly get feedback!
                I have big plans for what to build in the future, but this set
                of features was the smallest one I could think of that would
                provide some value.

                Flower lets you train ML models on data that is distributed
                across many user devices or “silos” (separate data sources)
                without having to move the data. This approach is called
                federated learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                A silo can be anything from a single user device to the data of
                an entire organization. For example, your smartphone keyboard
                suggestions and auto-corrections can be driven by a personalized
                ML model learned from your own private keyboard data, as well as
                data from other smartphone users, without the data being
                transferred from anyone’s device.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the famous AI breakthroughs—from ChatGPT and Google
                Translate to DALL·E and Stable Diffusion—were trained with
                public data from the web. When the data is all public, you can
                collect it in a central place for training. This “move the data
                to the computation” approach fails when the data is sensitive or
                distributed across organizational silos and user devices.
              </p>
              <p>Many important use cases are affected by this limitation:</p>
              <p>
                * Generative AI: Many scenarios require sensitive data that
                users or organizations are reluctant to upload to the cloud. For
                example, users might want to put themselves and friends into
                AI-generated images, but they don't want to upload and share all
                their photos.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Healthcare: We could potentially train cancer detection models
                better than any doctor, but no single organization has enough
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Finance: Preventing financial fraud is hard because individual
                banks are subject to data regulations, and in isolation, they
                don't have enough fraud cases to train good models.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Automotive: Autonomous driving would be awesome, but
                individual car makers struggle to gather the data to cover the
                long tail of possible edge cases.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Personal computing: Users don't want certain kinds of data to
                be stored in the cloud, hence the recent success of
                privacy-enhancing alternatives like the Signal messenger or the
                Brave browser. Federated methods open the door to using
                sensitive data from personal devices while maintaining user
                privacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Foundation models: These get better with more data, and more
                diverse data, to train them on. But again, most data is
                sensitive and thus can't be incorporated, even though these
                models continue to grow bigger and need more information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of us has worked on ML projects in various settings, (e.g.,
                corporate environments, open-source projects, research labs).
                We’ve worked on AI use cases for companies like Samsung,
                Microsoft, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz. One of our biggest
                challenges was getting the data to train AI while being
                compliant with regulations or company policies. Sometimes this
                was due to legal or organizational restrictions; other times, it
                was difficulties in physically moving large quantities of data
                or natural concerns over user privacy. We realized issues of
                this kind were making it too difficult for many ML projects to
                get off the ground, especially in domains like healthcare and
                finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Federated learning offers an alternative — it doesn't require
                moving data in order to train models on it, and so has the
                potential to overcome many barriers for ML projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                In early 2020, we began developing the open-source Flower
                framework to simplify federated learning and make it
                user-friendly. Last year, we experienced a surge in Flower's
                adoption among industry users, which led us to apply to YC. In
                the past, we funded our work through consulting projects, but
                looking ahead, we’re going to offer a managed version for
                enterprises and charge per deployment or federation. At the same
                time, we’ll continue to run Flower as an open-source project
                that everyone can continue to use and contribute to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Federated learning can train AI models on distributed and
                sensitive data by moving the training to the data. The learning
                process collects whatever it can, and the data stays where it
                is. Because the data never moves, we can train AI on sensitive
                data spread across organizational silos or user devices to
                improve models with data that could never be leveraged until
                now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s how it works: (0) Initialize the global model parameters
                on the server; (1) Send the model parameters to a number of
                organizations/devices (client nodes); (2) Train model locally on
                the data of each organization/device (client node); (3) Return
                the updated model parameters back to the server; (4) On the
                server, aggregate the model updates (e.g., by averaging them)
                into a new global model; (5): Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the
                model converges.
              </p>
              <p>
                This, of course, is more challenging than centralized learning:
                we must move AI models to data silos or user devices, train
                locally, send updated models back, aggregate them, and repeat.
                Flower provides the open-source infrastructure to easily do
                this, as well as supporting other privacy-enhancing technologies
                (PETs). It is compatible with PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Hugging
                Face, Fastai, Weights &amp; Biases and all the other tools used
                in ML projects regularly. The only dependency on the server side
                is NumPy, but even that can be dropped if necessary. Flower uses
                gRPC under the hood, so a basic client can easily be
                auto-generated, even for most languages that are not supported
                today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Flower is open-source (Apache 2.0 license) and can be run in all
                kinds of environments: on a personal workstation for development
                and simulation, on Google Colab, on a compute cluster for
                large-scale simulations or on a cluster of Raspberry Pi’s (or
                similar devices) to build research systems, or deployed on
                public cloud instances (AWS, Azure, GCP, others) or private
                on-prem hardware. We are happy to help users when deploying
                Flower systems and will soon make this even easier through our
                managed cloud service.
