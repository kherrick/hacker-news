                Ollama enables deploying LLMs models locally on laptops and edge
                severs, Cactus enables deploying on phones. Deploying directly
                on phones facilitates building AI apps and agents capable of
                phone use without breaking privacy, supports real-time inference
                with no latency, we have seen personalised RAG pipelines for
                users and more.

                Apple and Google actively went into local AI models recently
                with the launch of Apple Foundation Frameworks and Google AI
                Edge respectively. However, both are platform-specific and only
                support specific models from the company. To this end, Cactus:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Is available in Flutter, React-Native &amp; Kotlin
                Multi-platform for cross-platform developers, since most apps
                are built with these today.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Supports any GGUF model you can find on Huggingface; Qwen,
                Gemma, Llama, DeepSeek, Phi, Mistral, SmolLM, SmolVLM,
                InternVLM, Jan Nano etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Accommodates from FP32 to as low as 2-bit quantized models,
                for better efficiency and less device strain.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Have MCP tool-calls to make them performant, truly helpful
                (set reminder, gallery search, reply messages) and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Fallback to big cloud models for complex, constrained or
                large-context tasks, ensuring robustness and high availability.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's completely open source. Would love to have more people try
                it out and tell us how to make it great!

              Leaping lets you build voice AI agents in a multi-stage,
              graph-like format that makes testing and improvement much easier.
              By evaluating each stage of a call, we can trace errors and
              regressions to a particular stage. Then we autonomously vary the
              prompt for that stage and A/B test it, allowing agents to
              self-improve over time.
              <p>
                You can talk to one of our bots directly at
                <a href="https://leapingai.com">https://leapingai.com</a>, and
                there’s a demo video at

              </p>
              <p>
                Large companies are understandably reluctant to have AI start
                picking up their phone calls—the technology kind of works, but
                often not very well. If they do take the plunge, they often end
                up spending months tuning the prompts for just one use-case, and
                sometimes never even end up releasing the voice bot.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem is two-sided: it's non-trivial to specify the exact
                way a bot should behave using plain language, and it's tedious
                to ensure the LLM always follows your instructions the way you
                intended them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Existing voice AI solutions are a pain to set up for complex use
                cases. They require months of prompting all edge cases before
                going live, and then months of monitoring and improving
                prompting afterwards. We do that better than human prompters,
                and much faster, by running a continuous analysis + testing
                loop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our tech is roughly divided into three subcomponents: core
                library, voice server, and self-improvement logic. Core library
                models and executes the multi-stage (think n8n-style) voice
                agents. For the voice server we are using the ol’ reliable
                cascading way of STT-&gt;LLM-&gt;TTS. We tried out the
                voice-to-voice models, and although they felt really great to
                talk to, function-calling performance was expectedly much worse,
                so we are still waiting for them to get better.
              </p>
              <p>
                The self-improvement works by first taking conversation metrics
                and evaluation results to produce ‘feedback’, i.e. specific
                ideas how the voice agent setup could be improved. After enough
                feedback is collected, we trigger a run of a specialized
                self-improvement agent. It is a cursor-style AI with access to
                various tools that changes the main voice agent. It can rewrite
                prompts, configure a stage to use a summarized conversation
                instead of a full one, and more. Each iteration produces a new
                snapshot of the agent, enabling us to route a small part of the
                traffic to it and promote it to production if things look ok.
                This loop can be set to run without any human involvement, thus
                making agents self-improve.

                Leaping is use-case agnostic, but we currently focus on inbound
                customer support (travel, retail, real estate, etc.) and lead
                pre-qualification (medicare, home services, performance
                marketing) since we have a lot of success stories there.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started out in Germany since that’s where we were in
                university, but initially growth was challenging. We decided to
                target enterprise customers right away and they showed
                reluctance to adopt voice AI as the front-door ‘face’ of their
                company. Additionally, for an enterprise with thousands of calls
                daily, it is infeasible to monitor all the calls and tune agents
                manually. To address their very valid concerns, we put all
                effort into reliability—and still haven’t gotten around to
                offering self-serve access, which is one reason we don’t have
                fixed pricing yet. (Also, with some clients we have
                outcome-based pricing, i.e. you pay nothing for calls that
                didn't convert a lead, only the ones that did.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Things picked up momentum ever since we got into YC and moved to
                the US, but the cautious sentiment is also present here if you
                try to sell to big enterprises. We believe that doing evals,
                simulation, and A/B testing really really well is our
                competitive edge and what will enable us to solve large,
                sensitive use cases.
              </p>
              <p>We’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!</p>

                No invite system unlike bunch of others – you can download it
                today from our website or GitHub:
                <a href="https://github.com/browseros-ai/BrowserOS"
                  >https://github.com/browseros-ai/BrowserOS</a

              <p>
                --- Why bother building an alternative? We believe browsers will
                become the new operating systems, where we offload much bunch of
                our work to AI agents. But these agents will have access to all
                your sensitive data – emails, docs, on top of your browser
                history. Open-source, privacy-first alternatives need to exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're not a search or ad company, so no weird incentives. Your
                data stays on your machine.
                <i>You can use local LLMs with Ollama</i>. We also support BYOK
                (bring your own keys), so no $200/month plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another big difference vs Perplexity Comet: our agent runs
                locally in your browser (not on their server). You can actually
                watch it click around and do stuff, which is pretty cool! Short
                demo here:

              <p>
                --- How we built? We patch Chromium's C++ source code with our
                changes, so we have the same security as Google Chrome. We also
                have an auto-updater for security patches and regular updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working with Chromium's 15M lines of C++ has been another fun
                adventure that I'm writing a blog post on. Cursor/VSCode breaks
                at this scale, so we're back to using grep to find stuff and
                make changes. Claude code works surprisingly well too.
              </p>
              <p>Building the binary takes ~3 hours on our M4 Max MacBook.</p>
              <p>
                --- Next? We're just 2 people with a lot of work ahead (Firefox
                started with 3 hackers, history rhymes!). But we strongly
                believe that a privacy-first browser with local LLM support is
                more important than ever – since agents will have access to so
                much sensitive data.

              <p>I'm a solopreneur and run a web design agency.</p>
              <p>
                I create open-source apps, but I also work as a freelancer and
                designer. I was accepting any new freelance project via forms on
                my agency website.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was using Typeform, but as time went by and more people
                submitted forms, it got more and more expensive. That time, I
                thought to use Google Form, but it was way too blocky and looked
                very unprofessional on my agency website.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I thought to build my own forms for my own usage, and it
                turns out it almost doubled form submissions and inquiry calls.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was happy, so I thought to build it for everyone and make it
                open-source.
              </p>
              <p>
                I added AI functionalities using Vercel AISDK. I can generate
                forms almost instantly using AI and also added analytics AI so
                that users can talk with their forms—more like talk with their
                analytics data.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've been building this publicly, sharing updates on my X
                account (preetsuthar17)
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope this product will be as helpful to you as it was for me.
                Would love your feedback pls
              </p>

              <p>
                I have ~10% vested. I led our early fundraise, worked unpaid for
                months, and contributed personal capital. I’m not trying to
                maximize my return—but I also don’t want to walk away
                empty-handed after 1.5 years of building.
              </p>
              <p>
                My question: 1. What’s a fair exit package in this situation? A
                formula/rule I can use?
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Should I just keep the vested equity? Future investors may
                see this as dead equity.
              </p>
              <p>3. Is a cash buyout common or appropriate?</p>
              <p>
                How would you approach this with the board/co-founder in a way
                that’s constructive and protects long-term relationships?
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love to hear from anyone who's seen this play out—on the
                founder, investor, or legal side.

              <p>
                I've built [CXXStateTree](<a
                  href="https://github.com/ZigRazor/CXXStateTree"
                  >https://github.com/ZigRazor/CXXStateTree</a
                >), a modern C++ header-only library to create hierarchical
                state machines with clean, intuitive APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                It supports: - Deeply nested states - Entry/exit handlers -
                State transitions with guards and actions - Asynchronous
                transitions with `co_await` (C++20 coroutines) - Optional
                runtime type identification for flexibility
              </p>
              <p>
                It's ideal for complex control logic, embedded systems, games,
                robotics, and anywhere you'd use a finite state machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d love feedback, use cases, or contributions from the
                community!
