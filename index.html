                No placeholders. No typing. Letters are ready to copy and paste.
              </p>
              <p>
                The workflow is: 1. Upload your resume (PDF) - it gets parsed
                and cached in your browser. 2. Paste the job description 3. Get
                a personalized cover letter in ~5 seconds
              </p>
              <p>
                It connects to any OpenAI-compatible local LLM endpoint. I use
                it with Ollama + llama3.2, but it works with any local model
                server.
              </p>
              <p>
                Key features: - 100% local and private depending on the LLM of
                your choice - Smart resume parsing with pdf-parse -
                Multi-language support (you can add more languages) - Editable
                output with one-click copy
              </p>
              <p>
                I made this because I was tired of wasting time with writing
                letters while applying for jobs. All other tools I tried weren't
                as quick as I wanted because I still needed to modify the
                letters to replace placeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also didn't find any tool that let's me use my local LLM for
                free, and I didn't want to pay for ChatGPT/Claude API calls for
                every job application.
              </p>
              <p>
                The output quality is good, and it can bypass some AI detectors.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's open source too and free to use. You can self-host it or
                run it locally in development mode.

              <p>
                At 100x.bot, we are building the interface for this future. We
                are not just another "AI Wrapper." We are a deep-tech company
                backed by Y Combinator, Accel, and Inventus, solving the hardest
                problem in automation: making browser agents reliable, fast, and
                accessible to everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most AI agents today are slow, expensive, and hallucinate
                frequently because they "think too hard" about every click. We
                take a different approach: "Record once, Automate forever." We
                combine the deterministic speed of record-and-replay technology
                with the semantic intelligence of LLMs to create agents that
                utilize self-healing DOM maps to navigate the chaotic web with
                human-like resilience.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Opportunity: More Than Just UI We are looking for a Frontend
                Craftsperson to join our core engineering team in Bangalore.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not a role for someone who just wants to center divs or
                convert Figma files into React components. We are looking for an
                engineer who can architect the client-side experience for
                autonomous agents. You will be building the "cockpit" from which
                users control their digital workforce.
              </p>
              <p>
                What You Will Architect The Agent Visualization Engine: You will
                build complex, interactive graph-based interfaces that visualize
                agent workflows. Users need to see the logic flow—loops,
                conditionals, and "self-healing" events—in real-time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dynamic MCP Interfaces: You will build systems that dynamically
                generate UIs based on Model Context Protocol schemas. If an MCP
                server exposes a new tool, your UI should instantly adapt to
                support it, without a code deploy.
              </p>
              <p>
                High-Performance Streaming UI: Our agents generate massive logs
                (DOM snapshots, network events, execution traces). You will use
                virtualization (e.g., react-window) and atomic state management
                (Zustand/Jotai) to render these streams at 60fps, ensuring the
                UI never lags behind the bot.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "Recorder" Experience: You will refine our Chrome Extension
                overlay, ensuring it injects cleanly into any third-party
                website (using Shadow DOM encapsulation) to capture user intent
                without breaking the host page.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Tech Stack We run a modern, type-safe stack designed for
                velocity and reliability.
              </p>
              <p>Frontend: React, TypeScript, Next.js</p>
              <p>Styling: Tailwind CSS (with Shadow DOM handling)</p>
              <p>
                State: Zustand / TanStack Query (for high-frequency updates)
              </p>
              <p>
                Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP), WebSockets, Chrome
                Extension APIs
              </p>
              <p>
                Who You Are A React Expert (2+ Years): You understand the React
                reconciliation algorithm inside out. You know why useEffect is
                dangerous for high-frequency data and how to use useRef or
                useSyncExternalStore to optimize performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                TypeScript Native: You don't just use any. You write robust,
                generic types that mirror complex backend schemas. You are
                comfortable sharing types between the extension background
                script and the UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                A "Craftsperson": You care about micro-interactions. You
                understand that trust is built through UI feedback—a loading
                spinner, a hover state, a smooth transition. You take pride in
                building developer tools that feel like magic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Systems Thinker: You can reason about asynchronous systems. You
                understand race conditions, websocket reconnections, and the
                complexity of communicating between a Content Script, a
                Background Worker, and a React UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                High Agency: In a small YC team, nobody will hand you a ticket.
                You will identify problems, design solutions, and ship them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why Join 100x.bot? Work on the Bleeding Edge. You will be a
                pioneer in the space of AI Agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                YC Culture: We move fast. We ship daily. We value product
                instincts over bureaucracy. You will have significant ownership
                and equity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Complex Engineering: You won't be bored. You are building a
                browser automation engine, a recording studio, and an IDE—all in
                the browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                Work directly with Shardul and Parth to shape the product
                roadmap.

                We built a shared memory layer you can drop in as a Claude Code
                Skill. It’s basically a tiny memory DB with recall that
                remembers your sessions. Not magic. Not AGI. Just state.
              </p>
              <p>Install in Claude Code:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mutable-state-inc/ensue-skill
  /plugin install ensue-memory
  # restart Claude Code
</code></pre>
              What it does: (1) persists context between sessions (2) semantic
              &amp; temportal search (not just string grep). Basically git for
              your Claude brain
              <p>
                What it doesn’t do: - it won’t read your mind - it’s alpha; it
                might break if you throw a couch at it
              </p>
              <p>

                If you try it and it sucks, tell me why so I can fix it. Don't

              <p>
                This is done by measuring the minimum TCP RTT
                (client.socket.tcpi_min_rtt) seen and the smoothed TCP RTT
                (client.socket.tcpi_rtt). I am getting this data by using Fastly
                Custom VCL, they get this data from the Linux kernel (struct
                tcp_info -&gt; tcpi_min_rtt and tcpi_rtt). I am using Fastly for
                the Demo since they have PoPs all around the world and they
                expose TCP socket data to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                The score is calculated by doing tcpi_min_rtt/tcpi_rtt. It's
                simple but it's what worked best for this with the data Fastly
                gives me. Based on my testing, 1-0.7 is normal, 0.7-0.3 is
                normal if the connection is somewhat unstable (WiFi, mobile
                data, satellite...), 0.3-0.1 is low and may be a proxy, anything
                lower than 0.1 is flagged as TCP proxy by the current code.

              <p>
                We’re three engineers who’ve built and maintained large
                codebases, and kept wanting to work on as many features in
                parallel as possible. Git worktrees [1] have been a useful
                solution for this task but they’re annoying to spin up and
                manage. We started superset as a tool that uses the best
                practices we’ve discovered running parallel agents.
              </p>
              <p>Here is a demo video:</p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHJhKFX2S-4"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHJhKFX2S-4</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We all use Superset to build Superset, and it more than doubles
                our productivity (you’ll be able to tell from the autoupdates).
                We have many friends using it over their IDE of choice or
                replacing their terminals with Superset, and it seems to stick
                because they can keep using whatever CLI agent or tool they want
                while Superset just augments their existing set of tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Superset is written predominantly in Typescript and based on
                Electron, xterm.js, and node-pty. We chose xterm+node-pty
                because it's a proven way to run real PTYs in a desktop app
                (used by VSCode and Hyper), and Electron lets us ship fast.
                Next, we’re exploring features like running worktrees in cloud
                VMs to offload local resources, context sharing between agents,
                and a top-level orchestration agent for managing many worktrees
                or projects at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve learned a lot building this: making a good terminal is
                more complex than you’d think, and terminal and git defaults
                aren’t universal (svn vs git, weird shell setups, complex
                monorepos, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Building a product for yourself is way faster and quite fun.
                It's early days, but we’d love you to try Superset across all
                your CLI tools and environments, we welcome your feedback! :)
