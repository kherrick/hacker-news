                The goal was to make it easy to visually design shadcn color
                themes, preview them live across various example UIs, and export
                them straight into your projects (as CSS or via the shadcn CLI
                registry command).
              </p>
              <p>
                I had a bit of experience going into this because I built the
                Theme Studio for VS Code in the past, but it was fun using a
                modern stack and leveraging Cursor to help me along the way this
                time.

                Backstory -- I joined my current team a year ago. It was falling
                apart. The team members hated each other and were trying to get
                each other fired. The team lead who’d joined a quarter before
                had quit to join another team largely due to conflict with one
                difficult coworker.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I joined as the lead. I helped to stabilize the team over
                the last year. It’s grown from four to ten engineers. Three
                engineers joined specifically to work with me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet the entire time I’ve been on that team, that one difficult
                coworker has been criticizing and fighting almost everything
                I’ve done. That coworker was relatively inexperienced, yet was
                told by a previous director that he was meant to be the lead of
                this platform. Hence the fighting with the other lead from a
                year ago. And with me over the past year. It’s burning me out
                bad.
              </p>
              <p>
                It mostly comes across in passive-aggressive comments, and in
                trying to argue and prove he is right about trivial things, with
                every bit of disagreement. It used to come up in terms of
                aggression towards his peers. That stopped when me and my
                manager intervened. Yet continues with me. It's clear he doesn't
                respect me as lead, and makes that clear in team meetings.
              </p>
              <p>
                It makes everything harder. Even in an incident that caused a
                global outage for three hours, and where we didn't have alerts
                and had to get told by our users we were down, I get pushback on
                calling for a post-mortem since his work was involved. Now I
                have to back-channel to my manager (who wasn't in the room), and
                still face the . Just the friction alone that he adds in getting
                anything done makes doing the right thing often not worth it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm at a loss. My other teammates love working with me. I was
                promoted last year. I'm two levels above this guy which means my
                company trusts me. I'm frankly wishing I could leave the team
                but it's difficult to transfer since I'm in something of a
                specialty and there aren't other positions at my level in the
                company.
              </p>
              <p>
                My manager's been resistant to doing much of anything. I think
                he's tired of me bringing it up. He says that the engineer "gets
                along with [junior engineer who never disagrees with him]". He
                says the difficult engineer is improving and sees him trying.
                His feedback to me is not to let it bother me so much. He asks
                me what he should do to change his behavior (he's the manager,
                not me...).
              </p>
              <p>
                I really just want to be able to come in to work and do my job
                without dealing with an asshole trying to one-up me or "score
                points" against me all day and without expecting conflict every
                time we're in the same meeting. I'm tired of the status and
                perception games and his overall impact on the team vibe and
                culture.
