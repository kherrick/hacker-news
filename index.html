              <p>## Features</p>
              <p>
                *Efficient Token Use:* iterm-mcp gives the model the ability to
                inspect only the output that the model is interested in. The
                model typically only wants to see the last few lines of output
                even for long running commands.
              </p>
              <p>
                *Natural Integration:* You share iTerm with the model. You can
                ask questions about what's on the screen, or delegate a task to
                the model and watch as it performs each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                *Full Terminal Control and REPL support:* The model can start
                and interact with REPL's as well as send control characters like
                ctrl-c, ctrl-z, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                *Easy on the Dependencies:* iterm-mcp is built with minimal
                dependencies and is runnable via npx. It's designed to be easy
                to add to Claude Desktop and other MCP clients. It should just
                work.
              </p>
              <p>## Real-World Example: Debugging Sidekiq Jobs</p>
              <p>
                I needed to debug a Sidekiq job with complex arguments. The
                arguments were partially obfuscated in the logs. I asked Claude:
                "open rails console, show me arguments for the latest XYZ job".
                The model:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Launched Rails console 2. Retrieved job details 3. Displayed
                the arguments that I was looking for
              </p>
              <p>## Architectural Journey</p>
              <p>
                This project had a couple interesting constraints around command
                execution:
              </p>
              <p>### 1. Token Efficiency Challenge</p>
              <p>
                I wanted to constrain tokens as much as possible. I didn't want
                to send the entire output of a long running command to the
                model, but there's not a great way to know which parts of the
                output are important to what the model is doing. Sampling could
                be used here, but it's not well supported yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                *Solution:* I arrived at a pull-based solution for this. The
                command from the model is sent to the terminal, and the model is
                made aware of how many lines of output were generated. The model
                can choose to retrieve as many lines of the buffer that it
                thinks are relevant.
              </p>
              <p>### 2. Long-Running Process Support</p>
              <p>
                I wanted to support long running processes. It turns out that
                when you run `brew install ffmpeg` - it takes a while, and it's
                not always clear when the job is done. In early proof of
                concepts, the model would assume the command completed
                successfully and begin sending additional commands to the
                terminal before the first command had finished.
              </p>
              <p>
                *Solution:* iTerm provides a way to ask if the terminal is
                waiting for user input, but I found that it tended to show false
                positives in certain situations. For example, a long running
                command would result in iTerm reporting that the terminal was
                waiting for input when in fact the command was still running. I
                found that inspecting the processes associated with the terminal
                and waiting until the most interesting of those processes
                settles to a low resource usage is a fair indicator of long
                running commands being ready for input.
              </p>
              <p>## Requirements</p>
              <p>* iTerm2 must be running</p>
              <p>* Node version 18 or greater</p>
              <p>## Safety Considerations</p>
              <p>* The user is responsible for using the tool safely.</p>
              <p>
                * No built-in restrictions: iterm-mcp makes no attempt to
                evaluate the safety of commands that are executed.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Models can behave in unexpected ways. The user is expected to
                monitor activity and abort when appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                * For multi-step tasks, you may need to interrupt the model if
                it goes off track. Start with smaller, focused tasks until
                you're familiar with how the model behaves.

              <p>
                We built Workflow86 to help teams build and automate their
                internal business processes and workflows using drag and drop
                components like forms, tasks, tables and nodes for business
                logic, API requests, running custom code etc. It works as a
                standalone process/workflow automation tool, or as a workflow
                customization layer on top of existing apps and systems like
                HRIS, CRM and ERP.
              </p>
              <p>
                One common problem we hear from users is that no-code still has
                a significant learning curve, and it can take some time to
                understand how to properly build something. Users also needed
                help with knowing what to build in the first place, or what a
                process might or should look like.
              </p>
              <p>
                To solve this, we've integrated an AI that acts as a business
                analyst/consultant and workflow automation engineer. This AI is
                powered by a combination of Large Language Models and lots of
                prompt engineering, RAG and prompt chaining techniques we
                developed along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                See a demo of it in action here:
                <a
                  href="https://www.loom.com/share/fdbd5ad64c8f4071a062ecaa6a6d01f1?sid=a84ac71b-4639-4e2c-ae9e-33a3c30006d4"
                  >https://www.loom.com/share/fdbd5ad64c8f4071a062ecaa6a6d01f1?...</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                In business analyst/consultant mode, the AI helps users
                brainstorm ideas, identify and discover processes and draft what
                a process should look like. Like a business analyst/consultant,
                the AI works to pull and extract information and details from
                the user by asking the right questions rather than rely on the
                user's instructions alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the required information has been gathered, the AI goes
                into engineer mode: it will plan and then build the entire
                workflow by selecting the right nodes, connecting them together
                and then fully configuring every single node individually as
                well. This includes writing custom code and API requests using
                stored credentials when required.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a workflow is built, edits can be done manually or by
                asking the AI to adjust the workflow at any time (e.g., “Add a
                compensation band check before final approval”). The AI has full
                context of the current state of the workflow, so it can “patch”
                in any changes like adding new nodes, rewriting existing nodes
                and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some use cases we’ve seen from customers include building: -
                automated compliance checks for new CRM leads - custom
                international contractor onboarding workflows on top of a HRIS -
                automated vendor risk assessment before ERP updates
              </p>
              <p>
                Try it out and let us know how the AI performs and any other
                feedback you have!

              <a href="https://gokarsa.com">https://gokarsa.com</a>). Karsa
              makes it easy for anyone in emerging markets to buy and save in
              stablecoins to protect against currency instability and inflation.
              Here’s a quick demo:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C160H4yB08w#t=11"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C160H4yB08w#t=11</a
              >.
              <p>
                Over a billion people live in countries with severe inflation
                and are unable to protect their wealth due to strict capital
                controls. The banking systems in most of these countries are
                designed to prevent access to assets like dollars—good luck
                getting a foreign currency account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working in the crypto industry, we spent a lot of time thinking
                about how it can solve problems for people in the real world.
                Eventually, we saw a real, grassroots use-case emerge—one
                outside of the US entirely: people in developing countries
                started to use crypto exchanges like Binance to hold
                dollar-denominated stablecoins, which preserved their wealth
                from inflation. However, these exchanges primarily cater to
                traders and are still too complex (and crypto-focused) for
                average users, hindering mass-market adoption.
              </p>
              <p>
                We knew this was a problem we wanted to work on after speaking
                to our family and friends: when Shahryar tried explaining crypto
                to his uncle in Pakistan, it was all jargon until he explained
                stablecoins, which immediately clicked. For someone who is (1)
                earning in a currency thatʼs inflating 20-30% year-over-year,
                (2) whoʼs structurally limited from dollar access, and (3) makes
                payments abroad regularly, this makes a massive difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                Karsa looks and feels like a bank/currency exchange to an
                average user—they choose an amount and buy dollar-denominated
                stablecoins at a market price. But under the hood, we route our
                supply from a network of verified peer-to-peer stablecoin
                traders, whom buyers are making their deposit payments to.
              </p>
              <p>
                (1) A seller sets their price and deposits money in an escrow
                smart contract (programmable rules-based code, can only return
                or release funds between seller and buyer).
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) A buyer gets matched with that order upon setting their
                criteria, and has to send a fiat payment (e.g., bank transfer,
                payment app, etc.) to the sellerʼs local account + upload a
                photo for verification.
              </p>
              <p>
                (3) We verify the fiat payment with the seller directly, handle
                any disputes, etc., and then release the escrowed stablecoins to
                a digital wallet weʼve created for the buyer.
              </p>
              <p>
                How is this different? Structuring it as peer-to-peer allows us
                to actually be global from day one and circumvent government
                interference—in most of these markets, centralized products
                (i.e., requiring a bank account in the relevant country) often
                get shut down. This means that in many of the regions we operate
                in, weʼre the only way anyone can reasonably get access to
                stablecoins.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, weʼve abstracted away the ‘P2P partʼ. In other
                exchanges, buyers and sellers engage in chats for each
                transaction (to confirm details, etc.). This is onerous for
                sellers and off-putting for new buyers. Instead, we sit in the
                middle, matching price orders and managing verification,
                appeals, etc. with sellers directly—much less work for sellers,
                and a simple process for buyers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Weʼve also abstracted away as much about crypto as possible—no
                crypto knowledge, wallet / key management, etc. is needed. User
                funds are held in self-custody crypto wallets, meaning your
                money is always yours—unlike a centralized exchange (e.g., FTX)
                thereʼs no way for us to access, freeze, or lose your funds.
              </p>
              <p>
                We currently take a 1% transaction fee, though we eventually
                intend to adjust it proportionally to regional FX rates. Over
                time, we want to support more of the average personʼs financial
                stack, and are exploring highly-requested features including
                freelancer payouts, spending via a card, US treasury yield, etc.

              <p>
                This makes it easy to create music in 3D, and experiment with
                new techniques which aren’t possible in traditional DAWs and
                plugins.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d love to get any feedback on this software (Mac/Windows) to
                make it better.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                We’re are an open source dev tool company. Over the past couple
                of months, we’ve spoken with dozens of software companies to
                understand their challenges with on-prem deployments. We
                analyzed the internal tools they’ve built and the best practices
                from existing solutions, combining them into a prebuilt, Open
                Source solution that works out of the box and integrates
                seamlessly.
              </p>
              <p>Distr consists of two key components:</p>
              <p>
                1. Hub - Provides a centralized view of all deployments and
                controls connected agents. - Comes with a simple GUI but also
                supports API and SDK access for seamless integration. - Fully
                Open- Surce and self-hostable, or you can use our fully managed
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Lightweight Agents - Pre-built agents for Helm (Kubernetes)
                and Docker Compose (VM) that run alongside your application. -
                Handle lifecycle tasks like guided installation, updates, and
                rollbacks. - Provide basic metrics (health status, application
                version) and logs
              </p>
              <p>
                If you already have a customer portal or self-service interface
                for on-prem deployments, you can seamlessly integrate all
                features into your existing portal or application using our API
                or SDK. Alternatively, you can use our pre-built, white-labeled
                customer portal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s what an integration into your existing customer portal
                could look like:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  import {DistrService} from "@glasskube/distr-sdk";
  
  const customerHasAutoUpdatesEnabled = false; // replace with your own logic
  const deploymentTargetId = 'da1d7130-bfa9-49a1-b567-c49728837df7';
  const service = new DistrService({
      apiKey: 'distr-8c24167aeb5fd4bb48b6d2140927df0f'
  });
  
  const result = await service.isOutdated(deploymentTargetId);
  if(result.deploymentTarget.deployment?.latestStatus?.type !== 'ok') {
      // let the user decide whether to allow updates from an instable state, e.g. with:
      if(!confirm('The deployment is not in a stable state. Do you want to update anyway?')) {
          return;
      }
  }
  if(result.outdated) {
      if(customerHasAutoUpdatesEnabled) {
          await service.updateDeployment({deploymentTargetId});
          // notify customer about the update
      } else {
          const newerVersionsAvailable = result.newerVersions;
          // notify customer about the newer versions, e.g. via email
      }
  }


</code></pre>
              With the SDK/API, you can: - Display real-time deployed version
              and deployment status directly within the application, notifying
              customers when their deployed version is outdated. - Allow
              customers to trigger updates from within your app using a simple
              API call
              <p>
                If you’re distributing software and want to streamline updates
                or enhance monitoring, we’d love your feedback and are here to
                answer any questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting started is easy—just bring your Docker Compose file or
                Helm chart, and we’ll guide you through the rest.
