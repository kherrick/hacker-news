            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I did some rudimentary research and came to the opinion that
                OpenBSD might be the most secure OS.
              </p>
              <p>I am looking at.</p>
              <p>- security (from hacking and spyware installations)</p>
              <p>- usability (Tails is not practical in my case)</p>
              <p>- availability of important tools I use.</p>
              <p>
                Anyways after some research I later came to choosing between
                either Trisquel or OpenBSD (maybe FreeBSD)
              </p>
              <p>
                I have not used BSD before. But it seems it's the most secure OS
                out there.
              </p>
              <p>My questions.</p>
              <p>1. What has been your experience with OpenBSD?</p>
              <p>2. What are the pros &amp; cons of using Open BSD?</p>
              <p>
                3. What laptop would run OpenBSD best? (I am looking at the
                Razer Balde)
              </p>
              <p>
                Given my requirements, do you have any other technologies you
                recommend I use?
              </p>
              <p>
                Was choosing OpenBSD over Trisquel (Trisquel is Stallman
                endorsed) a better choice for someone who is concerned about
                privacy &amp; security?
              </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>
                I know Web Components are in a bit of a drama cycle right now.
                I’m happy to see them get any attention really. I’ve been pretty
                bullish on them since ~2013 when I started working with them, at
                least in the context of a <i>widget</i> like a video player.
                I’ve even given many related talks on them like this one (<a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Mh84SRoDg"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Mh84SRoDg</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                I would never push them for a large app or as a full replacement
                for React, but they’ve been incredible for making video players
                that are compatible across many contexts, and Player.style is a
                clear demonstration of that when you get to the step of
                embedding a theme. Web components really shine for building bits
                of UI that can be shared between projects. They also are the
                best way to avoid the long term JS framework thrash that’s a
                challenge for any developer who works on the web for long
                enough. One of the best decisions I ever made for Video.js was
                to <i>not</i> build it with jQuery. Video.js is 15 years old now
                and still in use, while all the jQuery players are not.
              </p>
              <p>
                For some added context of this project, when I was building
                Video.js back in 2010 I put a lot of thought into how other
                developers would customize the player controls. I was excited to
                use web technologies (instead of Flash) to build a player and I
                <i>knew</i> other web devs would be too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fast forward 14 years — Video.js has been used on millions of
                websites including Twitter, Instagram, Amazon, Dropbox, Linkedin
                and even in United Airlines headrests. In 99.99% of those cases
                the default Video.js controls were used with little to no
                customization. So…huge adoption success, utter failure in
                sparking creativity. In retrospect, asking people to learn a new
                UI framework just to style their player was too much.
              </p>
              <p>
                Media Chrome and Player.style are my answer to that friction.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Media Chrome - A suite of Web Components and React Components
                that let you easily build a media player UI from scratch, using
                components you’re already familiar with.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Player.stye - Themes built with Media Chrome, showing the
                cross-player and cross-framework flexibility of Media Chrome
              </p>
              <p>
                Media Chrome is already used on sites like TED.com, Syntax.fm,
                and anywhere the Mux Player is used. We’ve spent the last few
                months building some great themes for Player.style. I probably
                had the most fun recreating the Youtube icon animations from
                scratch using SVGs and CSS. (Whoever made the originals, nicely
                done!)
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s all free and open source, so don’t hesitate to jump in if
                you’re interested in the project. And of course I’m happy to
                answer any questions.
