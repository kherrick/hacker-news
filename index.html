            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://trynia.ai">https://trynia.ai</a>), a SOTA context
              layer for AI coding agents. Nia lets tools like Cursor, Claude
              Code, and other MCP clients index and query real codebases and
              documentation so they stop hallucinating against outdated or wrong
              sources, with applications beyond coding agents to any AI system
              that requires grounded context across domains.
              <p>
                Coding agents are only as good as the context you give them.
                General models are trained on public code and documentation that
                is often old, and they usually have no idea what is inside your
                actual repo, internal wiki, or the exact version of a third
                party SDK you use. The result is very familiar: you paste URLs
                and code snippets into the prompt, the agent confidently uses an
                outdated API or the wrong framework version, and you spend more
                time verifying and correcting it than if you had written the
                code yourself. Once models are good enough at generating code,
                feeding them precise, up-to-date context becomes the bottleneck.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ran into this pattern first on my own projects when (a few
                months ago) I was still in high school in Kazakhstan, obsessed
                with codegen tools and trying every coding agent I could find. I
                saw it again when I got into YC and talked to other teams who
                were also trying to use agents on real work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first version of Nia was basically “my personal MCP server
                that knows my repos and favorite doc sites so I do not have to
                paste URLs into Cursor anymore.” Once I saw how much smoother my
                own workflow became, it felt obvious that this should be a
                product other people could use too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, Nia is an indexing and retrieval service with an
                MCP interface and an API. You point it at sources like GitHub
                repositories, framework or provider docs, SDK pages, PDF
                manuals, etc. We fetch and parse those with some simple
                heuristics for code structures, headings, and tables, then
                normalize them into chunks and build several indexes: a semantic
                index with embeddings for natural language queries; a symbol and
                usage index for functions, classes, types, and endpoints; a
                basic reference graph between files, symbols, and external docs;
                regex and file tree search for cases where you want
                deterministic matches over raw text.
              </p>
              <p>
                When an agent calls Nia, it sends a natural language query plus
                optional hints like the current file path, stack trace, or
                repository. Nia runs a mix of BM25 style search, embedding
                similarity, and graph walks to rank relevant snippets, and can
                also return precise locations like “this function definition in
                this file and the three places it is used” instead of just a
                fuzzy paragraph. The calling agent then decides how to use those
                snippets in its own prompt. One Nia deployment can serve
                multiple agents and multiple projects at once. For example, you
                can have Cursor, Claude Code, and a browser based agent all
                pointed at the same Nia instance that knows about your monorepo,
                your internal wiki, and the provider docs you care about. We
                keep an agent agnostic session record that tracks which sources
                were used and which snippets the user accepted. Any MCP client
                can attach to that session id, fetch the current context, and
                extend it, so switching tools does not mean losing what has
                already been discovered.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of work goes into keeping indexes fresh without
                reprocessing everything. Background workers periodically refetch
                configured sources, detect which files or pages changed, and
                reindex those incrementally. This matters because many of the
                worst “hallucinations” I have seen are actually the model
                quoting valid documentation for the wrong version. Fixing that
                is more about version and change tracking than about model
                quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                We ship Nia with a growing set of pre-indexed public sources.
                Today this includes around 6k packages from common frameworks
                and provider docs, plus package search over thousands of
                libraries from ecosystems like PyPI, npm, and RubyGems, as well
                as pre indexed /explore page where everyone can contribute their
                sources! The idea is that a new user can install Nia, connect
                nothing, and still get useful answers for common libraries.
                Then, as soon as you add your own repos and internal docs, those
                private sources are merged into the same index. Some examples of
                how people use Nia so far: - migrating from one payments
                provider or API version to another by indexing the provider docs
                plus example repos and letting the agent propose and iterate on
                patches; - answering “how do I do X in this framework” by
                indexing the framework source directly instead of relying only
                on official docs that might be stale; - turning an unfamiliar
                public codebase into a temporary wiki to self onboard, where you
                can ask structural questions and jump to specific files,
                functions, or commits; - building a browser agent that answers
                questions using up to date code and docs even when the public
                documentation lags behind.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nia is a paid product (<a href="https://www.trynia.ai/"
                  >https://www.trynia.ai/</a
                >) but we have a free tier that should be enough for individuals
                to try it on real projects. Above that there is a self-serve
                paid plan for heavier individual use, and organization plans
                with higher limits, SOC 2, seat based billing, and options for
                teams that want to keep indexing inside their own environment.
                For private GitHub repos we can clone and index locally so code
                does not leave your infrastructure.
              </p>
              <p>
                We store account details and basic telemetry like query counts
                and errors to operate the service, and we store processed
                representations of content you explicitly connect (chunks,
                metadata, embeddings, and small graphs) so we can answer
                queries. We do not train foundation models on customer content
                and we do not sell user data. Moreover, I can see Nia play out
                in the larger context of the agents space due to the global
                problem of providing reliable context to those systems. Early
                signals show that people are already using Nia for healthcare
                data, cloning Paul Graham by indexing all of his essays and
                turning him into an AI agent, using Naval’s archive to build a
                personalized agent, and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would love to get Nia into the hands of more engineers who are
                already pushing coding agents hard and see where it breaks. I am
                especially interested in hearing about failure modes, annoying
                onboarding steps, places where the retrieval logic is obviously
                wrong or incomplete, or any security concerns I should address.
                I will be in the thread to answer questions, share more
                technical details, and collect any brutal feedback you are
                willing to give!

              <p>
                I got tired of setting up tools I can't explain to a team in a
                few words like sops or git-crypt, just to store few files with
                environment variables or secrets, so I built lockenv as a simple
                alternative.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's basically a password-protected vault file you commit to
                git. No gpg keys, no cloud, just lockenv init, set a password,
                and lock/unlock the secrets.
              </p>
              <p>
                This tool integrates with OS keyring, so you're not typing
                passwords constantly. Should work on Mac/Linux/Windows, but I
                tested it only on linux so far.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am not trying to replace any mature / robust solution, just
                making small tool for simple cases, where I want to stop sharing
                secrets via slack.
              </p>
              <p>Feel free to try, thank you!</p>
