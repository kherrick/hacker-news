              >.
              <p>
                This is a build-up from our release a year ago (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41907719"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41907719</a
                >). We spent a year exploring how to blend agent mode with
                interactions to allow you more easily "vibe" with your data but
                still keeping in control. We don't think the future of data
                analysis is just "agent to do all for you from a high-level
                prompt" --- you should still be able to drive the open-ended
                exploration; but we also don't want you to do everything
                step-by-step. Thus we worked on this "interactive agent mode"
                for data analysis with some UI innovations.
              </p>
              <p>Our new demo features:</p>
              <p>
                * We want to let you import (almost) any data easily to get
                started exploration — either it's a screenshot of a web table,
                an unnormalized excel table, table in a chunk of text, a csv
                file, or a table in database, you should be able to load into
                the tool easily with a little bit of AI assistance.
              </p>
              <p>
                * We want you to easily choose between agent mode (more
                automation) vs interactive mode (more fine-grained control)
                yourself as you explore data. We designed an interface of "data
                threads": both your and agents' explorations are organized as
                threads so you can jump into any point to decide how you want to
                follow-up or revise using UI + NL instruction to provide
                fine-grained control.
              </p>
              <p>
                * The results should be easily interpretable. Data Formulator
                now presents "concept" behind the code generated by AI agents
                alongside code/explanation/data. Plus, you can compose a report
                easily based on your visualizations to share insights.
              </p>

                It is a casual gaming platform focused on simple multiplayer
                games that can be played in person with a central screen (like a
                TV) or remotely via video chat. You can also play on your smart
                Android based TVs via the app:

                (it was just released recently so could be buggy). It is also
                available directly in Discord:

              <p>
                It is playable in 9 languages and doesn’t require any downloads.
                Most games revolve around creativity in some shape or form. They
                can be played by just about anyone whether or not you consider
                yourself a “gamer”. If you can text, you can play these games.
              </p>
              <p>Why did I create it?</p>
              <p>
                Some of you may see the resemblance to Jackbox games. I have
                been a huge fan of them for 10+ years and enjoyed playing their
                games a lot. However, I found their support for other languages
                a bit lacking. While living in the Netherlands, I have
                encountered quite a few non-native English speakers and wanted
                to help them have a similar experience. Jackbox also has some
                fragmentation issues between app stores. I own their games on PC
                and PS4 but I can’t share a “license” between them. They also
                come out with a pack every year with 5 games. You never know if
                the game(s) will be fun, or if you should try to buy a previous
                pack with the one killer party game in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I designed Gametje with these issues in mind. It is playable in
                multiple languages with more being added regularly (feel free to
                request one). You can play it from any device with a web
                browser. There is no need to install it via Steam or a game
                console. All games are available in one place with no “packs” to
                buy.
              </p>
              <p>What’s up with the name?</p>
              <p>
                I have been living in the Netherlands for some years and part of
                my original motivation stems from wanting to give my friends
                here a game to play in their native language. It's way easier to
                be witty/funny in your mother tongue after all! Because of that,
                I wanted to incorporate something Dutch into the site's name.
                The suffix ‘-tje’ is one of the diminutive endings in Dutch and
                is meant to soften a word or make it "smaller". Game + tje =
                Gametje, or a little game. I have been informed by native Dutch
                speakers that it should have been ‘Gamepje’ to be "correct" but
                I liked the way Gametje sounded better.
              </p>
              <p>Where can I try it?</p>
              <p>
                Go here: <a href="https://gametje.com/">https://gametje.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                You can test it out as a guest without signing up in order to
                get a feel for the games. Clicking into each game gives a short
                explanation and a small example of the gameplay. When creating a
                game room, you can choose to host via a central screen, host and
                play from a single device (like a phone) or cast the main screen
                to a Chromecast. There is also an Android TV app available that
                was just recently released:
                <a
                  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gametje"
                  >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gametje</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                After creating a game room, you can join from another browser
                window or device. You can also add AI players if you want to try
                it out on your own, although it is a lot more fun with real
                people. I also created a discord channel:
                <a href="https://discord.gg/7jrftHuHp9"
                  >https://discord.gg/7jrftHuHp9</a
                >
                where you can find other users to play with. If you sign up for
                an account, you can opt-in as an alpha tester and see the new
                games as they are developed. It’ll also keep track of all your
                previous games and make sure not to duplicate content. You can
                review previous games as well and relish in your past victories.
              </p>
              <p>What am I looking for?</p>
              <p>
                I am interested in feedback about the whole concept and also the
                gameplay. Is it fun? What could be improved? Interested in

            <div class="text">
              <p>How it works:</p>
              <p>1. Records traces from live traffic (what gets captured)</p>
              <p>
                2. Replays traces as API tests with mocked responses (how replay
                works)
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Detects deviations between actual vs. expected output (what
                you get)
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike traditional mocking libraries, which require you to
                manually emulate how dependencies behave, Tusk Drift
                automatically records what these dependencies respond with based
                on actual user behavior and maintains recordings over time. The
                reason we built this is because of painful past experiences with
                brittle API test suites and regressions that would only be
                caught in prod.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our SDK instruments your Node service, similar to OpenTelemetry.
                It captures all inbound requests and outbound calls like
                database queries, HTTP requests, and auth token generation. When
                Drift is triggered, it replays the inbound API call while
                intercepting outbound requests and serving them from recorded
                data. Drift’s tests are therefore idempotent, side-effect free,
                and fast (typically &lt;100 ms per test). Think of it as a unit
                test but for your API.
              </p>
              <p>Our Cloud platform does the following automatically:</p>
              <p>
                - Updates the test suite of recorded traces to maintain
                freshness
              </p>
              <p>
                - Matches relevant Drift tests to your PR’s changes when running
                tests in CI
              </p>
              <p>
                - Surfaces unintended deviations, does root cause analysis, and
                suggests code fixes
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re excited to see this use case finally unlocked. The release
                of Claude Sonnet 4.5 and similar coding models have made it
                possible to go from failing test to root cause reliably. Also,
                the ability to do accurate test matching and deviation
                classification means running a tool like this in CI no longer
                contributes to poor DevEx (imagine the time otherwise spent
                reviewing test results).
              </p>
              <p>Limitations:</p>
              <p>
                - You can specify PII redaction rules but there is no default
                mode for this at the moment. I recommend first enabling Drift on
                dev/staging, adding transforms (<a
                  href="https://docs.usetusk.ai/api-tests/pii-redaction/basic-concepts"
                  >https://docs.usetusk.ai/api-tests/pii-redaction/basic-concep...</a
                >), and monitoring for a week before enabling on prod.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Expect a 1-2% throughput overhead. Transforms result in a 1.0%
                increase in tail latency when a small number of transforms are
                registered; its impact scales linearly with the number of
                transforms registered.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Currently only supports Node backends. Python SDK is coming
                next.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Instrumentation limited to the following packages (more to
                come):
