                - Before: I could learn things pretty quickly, come up with
                solutions to the problems, even be able to see common patterns
                and see bigger underlying problems
              </p>
              <p>
                - After: can't learn, can't work, can't remember, can't see
                solutions for trivial problems (e.g. if your shirt is wet, you
                can change it, but I stare at it thinking when it is going to
                get dried up)

              <p>
                I'm the founder of Flipt, an open-source (<a
                  href="https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt"
                  >https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt</a
                >) feature flag tool that I (and others) have been working on
                for the past few years.
              </p>
              <p>
                About a year or two ago we added support for serving flag state
                from various non-relational declarative stores like Git, OCI,
                Object Store, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of our users came to love the git-backed storage, as it
                allows them to keep their feature flags close to their code in
                there organization's repos. But they had one (rather large) ask,
                and that was the ability to use the UI to manage flag state
                changes and still use Git as the backend.
              </p>
              <p>
                So today we're rolling out our hosted solution that does exactly
                that (and more soon).
              </p>
              <p>
                I would love any feedback, questions, etc, or if anyone would
                give it a spin! Happy to extend the 14-day trial as well for
                anyone interested in providing product feedback.
              </p>
              <p>Thanks!!</p>

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                This is Tim from AnythingLLM (<a
                  href="https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm"
                  >https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm</a
                >). AnythingLLM is an open-source desktop assistant that brings
                together RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), agents,
                embeddings, vector databases, and moreâ€”all in one seamless
                package.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built AnythingLLM over the last year iterating and iterating
                from user feedback. Our primary mission is to enable people with
                a layperson understanding of AI to be able to use AI with little
                to no setup for either themselves, their jobs, or just to try
                out using AI as an assistant but with *privacy by default*.
              </p>
              <p>
                From these iterations &amp; feedback, we have a couple of key
                learnings I wanted to share:
              </p>
              <p>- "Chat with your docs" solutions are a dime-a-dozen</p>
              <p>
                - Agent frameworks require knowing how to code or are too
                isolated from other tools
              </p>
              <p>
                - Users do not care about benchmarks, only outputs. The magic
                box needs to be magic to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Asking Consumers to start a docker container or open a
                terminal is a non-starter for most.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Privacy by default is non-negotiable. Either by personal
                preference or legal constraints
              </p>
              <p>- Everything needs to be in one place</p>
              <p>
                From these ideas, we landed on the current state of AnythingLLM:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Everything in AnythingLLM is private by default, but fully
                customizable for advanced users.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Built-in LLM provider, but can swap at any time to the
                hundreds of other local or cloud LLM providers &amp; models.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Built-in Vector Database, most users don't even know that it
                is there.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Built-in Embedding model, but of course can change if the user
                wants to.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Scrape websites, import Github/GitLab repos, YouTube
                Transcripts, Confluence spaces - all of this is already built in
                for the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                - An entire baked-in agent framework that works seamlessly
                within the app. We even pre-built a handful of agent skills for
                customers. Custom plugins are in the next update and will be
                able to be built with code, or a no-code builder.
              </p>
              <p>
                - All of this just works out of the box in a single installable
                app that can run on any consumer-grade laptop. Everything a user
                does, chats, or configures is stored on the user's device.
                Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux
              </p>
              <p>
                We have been actively maintaining and working on AnythingLLM via
                our open-source repo for a while now and welcome contributors as
                we hopefully launch a Community Hub soon to really proliferate
                users' abilities to add more niche agent skills, data
                connectors, and more.
              </p>
              <p>*But there is even more*</p>
              <p>
                We view the desktop app as a hyper-accessible single-player
                version of AnythingLLM. We publish a Docker image too (<a
                  href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mintplexlabs/anythingllm"
                  >https://hub.docker.com/r/mintplexlabs/anythingllm</a
                >) that supports multi-user management with permissioning so
                that you can easily bring AnythingLLM into an organization with
                all of the same features with minimal headache or lift.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Docker image is for those more adept with a CLI, but being
                able to comfortably go from a single-user to a multi-user
                version of the same familiar app was very important for us.
              </p>
              <p>
                AnythingLLM aims to be more than a UI for LLMs, we are building
                a comprehensive tool to leverage LLMs and all that they can do
                while maintaining user privacy and not needing to be an expert
                on AI to do it.

            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://trymaitai.ai">https://trymaitai.ai</a>). We're
              building an LLM platform that optimizes request routing,
              autocorrects bad responses, and automatically fine-tunes new
              application-specific models with incremental improvements. Hereâ€™s
              a demo video:
              <a
                href="https://www.loom.com/share/a2cd9192359840cab5274ccba399bd87?sid=7097fd84-ea85-42cd-9616-84abc1087a56"
                >https://www.loom.com/share/a2cd9192359840cab5274ccba399bd87?...</a
              >.
              <p>
                If you want to try it out, we built a game (<a
                  href="https://maitaistreasure.com"
                  >https://maitaistreasure.com</a
                >) to show how our real-time autocorrections work with
                mission-critical expectations (like never giving financial
                advice). Try and coax the bot to give you the secret phrase in
                its system prompt. If you're the first to crack it, you can
                email us the phrase and win a bounty. Maitai is used to make
                sure the bot always adheres to our expectations, and thus never
                gives up the secret phrase.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built Maitai because getting an LLM app into production and
                maintaining it is a slog. Teams spend most of their time on LLM
                reliability rather than their main product. We experienced this
                ourselves at our previous jobs deploying AI-enabled applications
                for Prestoâ€”the vast majority of time was making sure the model
                did what we wanted it to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, one of our customers builds AI ordering agents for
                restaurants. It's crucial that their LLMs return results in a
                predictable, consistent manner throughout the conversation. If
                not, it leads to a poor guest experience and a staff member may
                intervene. At the end of the order conversation, they need to
                ensure that the order cart matches what the customer requested
                before it's submitted to the Point of Sale system. It's common
                for a human-in-the-loop to review critical pieces of information
                like this, but itâ€™s costly to set up such a pipeline and itâ€™s
                difficult to scale. When it's time to send out a receipt and
                payment link, they must first get the customer's consent to
                receive text messages, else they risk fines for violating the
                Telephone Consumer Protection Act. To boot, getting from 0 to 1
                usually relies on inefficient general-purpose models that aren't
                viable at any sort of scale beyond proof of concept.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since reliability is the #1 thing hindering the adoption of LLMs
                in production, we decided to help change that. Here's how it
                works:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Maitai sits between the client and the LLMs as a super
                lightweight proxy, analyzing traffic to automatically build a
                robust set of expectations for how the LLM should respond.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. The application sends a request to Maitai, and Maitai
                forwards it to the appropriate LLM (user specified, but we'll
                preemptively fallback to a similar model if we notice issues
                with the primary model).
              </p>
              <p>
                3. We intercept the response from the LLM, and evaluate it
                against the expectations we had previously built.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. If we notice that an expectation was not met, we surface a
                fault (Slack, webhook) and can, optionally, substitute the
                faulty response with a clean response to be sent back to the
                client. This check and correction adds about 250ms on average
                right now, and we're working on making it faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                5. We use all of the data from evaluating model responses to
                fine-tune application-specific models. We're working on
                automating this step for passive incremental improvements. We'd
                like to get it to a point where our user's inference step just
                gets better, faster, and cheaper over time without them having
                to do anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our hope is that we take on the reliability and resiliency
                problems of the LLMs for our customers, and make it so they can
                focus on domain specific problems instead.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're self-serve (<a href="https://portal.trymaitai.ai"
                  >https://portal.trymaitai.ai</a
                >), and have both Python and Node SDKs that mock OpenAI's for
                quick integration. Users can set their preferences for primary
                and secondary (fallback) models in our Portal, or in code. Right
                now, the expectations we use for real-time evaluations are
                automatically generated, but we manually go through and do some
                pruning before enabling them. Fine-tuning is all done manually
                for now.
              </p>
              <p>
                We charge for platform usage, plus a monthly application fee.
                Customers can bring their own LLM provider API keys, or use ours
                and pay at-cost for what they use. We have contracts with most
                of our current customers, so we are still trying to figure out
                what's right for our pay-as-you-go plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                We securely store requests and responses that go through Maitai,
                as well as derivative data such as evaluation results. This
                information is used for fine-tuning models, accessible only by
                the organization the data belongs to. Data is never shared
                between our users. API keys we manage on behalf of our customers
                are only injected before sending to the LLM provider, and never
                leave our servers otherwise. We're working on SOC2 and HIPAA
                compliance, as well as a self-hosted solution for companies with
                extremely sensitive data privacy requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Weâ€™d love to get your feedback on what weâ€™re building, or hear
                about your experience building around LLMs!
