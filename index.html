            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I'm Alex, a tech enthusiast. I'm excited to show you Jesth, a
                next-level human-readable data serialization format.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project started out as a markup language for writing the
                docstrings of functions that would ultimately be consumed by a
                documentation generator. Basically the idea was to split a
                docstring into sections like Description and Parameters. Each
                section would consist of a header in square brackets and a body
                (lines of text between two headers).
              </p>
              <p>Here's what a docstring for a sum function would look like:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  This function takes in two integers a and b and returns their sum.

  [parameters]
  - a: First integer
  - b: Second integer

  [return] 
  Sum of a and b
</code></pre>
              The Description section in the example above is actually an
              anonymous section, i.e., a section with an empty header.
              <p>
                Meanwhile, I was thinking of a way to automate part of my dev
                workflow by storing in a file commands grouped into tasks such
                as project creation, build, testing, release, et cetera.
                Similarly with the markup language for my documentation
                generator, I would use square brackets to define the tasks.
                Thus, a task would consist of a header and a body which would be
                a list of commands to be executed sequentially.
              </p>
              <p>
                I built this project and named it Backstage. Here is a
                hypothetical backstage.tasks file:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  [release]
  &amp; test
  &amp; generate_doc
  &amp; git_stuff
  &amp; build
  # upload to PyPI
  $ twine upload --skip-existing dist/*

  [git_stuff]
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m {message}
  $ git push origin master
</code></pre>
              The example above is illustrative only and would not work. It
              contains 2 sections "release" and "git_stuff". Running the
              "release" task from the command line is equivalent to sequentially
              executing the commands in the "release" section.
              <p>
                The documentation generator and the scripting language, despite
                the obvious similarity in their formats, did not share any
                parsing code. So, to stop repeating myself, I created a file
                format and its library named Jesth which stands for "Just
                Extract Sections Then Hack".
              </p>
              <p>
                The library acts as an incomplete INI file parser that only
                hands the programmer the sections (as headers and their
                associated bodies which are lists of strings). No further
                interpretation of the data is done by the parser, allowing the
                programmer to unleash their creativity through useful hacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In its latest iteration, Jesth has matured and also includes a
                proper and extensively tested hack to convert a compatible
                section into a dictionary data structure, making Jesth my de
                facto preferred format for config files. I find Jesth more
                readable than TOML, YAML, and JSON.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here, encoding a dictionary data structure in its own section
                with another section containing a prompt for ChatGPT:

  I want you to act as a detective story writer. I will provide you with
  two dictionary data structures representing the profiles of two people.
  Your goal is to write a thrilling neo-noir story. My first request is:
  "guess who the killer and victim is from the profiles, then build a story
  that includes every detail of the profiles".

                One way we can all directly make impact is making a commitment
                to make our software accessible to all, starting with educating
                ourselves about common mistakes folks make when designing UI
                that produce software that can't be used by folks who have
                temporary or long term low vision, low hearing, neurological,
                and other disabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a ton of free educational events on accessibility
                going on today, and if you don't have time today, find a
                recording, or listen to a podcast, there is a huge opportunity
                to make impact once you better understand the challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                A couple of years ago while doing research on accessibility I
                came across the Global Accessibility Awareness Day, and the GAAD
                foundation (https://accessibility.day/) - there are many such
                orgs, but if you consider yourself accessibility curious,
                today's a good day to get curious.

                It is automated and checks museum collection pages for changes
                in the "on view" status for the various impressions of "The
                Great Wave" by Katsushika Hokusai that are infrequently
                displayed around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've only seen two different impressions in the past 20 5 years
                and I want to see as many as I can.
              </p>
              <p>
                The automation is a bunch of Huginn scenarios scraping pages on
                a schedule and checking for changes. I can't do all museums this
                way, some simply don't have good websites, but enough are
                covered to make this project worthwhile. The hard work was
                finding all the collection pages, figuring out the data to be
                watched and settings up the automation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The static website presenting the results is hosted on a free
                Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute instance running Docker,
                EasyEngine for nginx. That's pretty much it!
