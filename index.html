              fully-managed, GPU-accelerated Spark + SQL solution. We deliver
              BigQuery's ease of use (or easier) while being significantly more
              cost-efficient and performant.
              <p>
                Here's a short demo video demonstrating ParaQuery (vs. BigQuery)
                on a simple ETL job:

                It's well known that GPUs are very good for many SQL and
                dataframe tasks, at least by researchers and GPU companies like
                NVIDIA. So much so that, in 2018, NVIDIA launched the RAPIDS
                program and the Spark-RAPIDS plugin (<a
                  href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids"
                  >https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids</a
                >). I actually found out because, at the time, I was trying to
                craft a CUDA-based lambda calculus interpreter…one of several
                ideas I didn't manage to implement, haha.
              </p>
              <p>
                There seems to be a perception among at least some engineers
                that GPUs are only good for AI, graphics, and maybe image
                processing (maybe! someone actually told me they thought GPUs
                are bad for image processing!) Traditional data processing
                doesn’t come to mind. But actually GPUs are good for this as
                well!
              </p>
              <p>
                At a high level, big data processing is a high-throughput,
                massively parallel workload. GPUs are a type of hardware
                specialized for this, are highly programmable, and (now) happen
                to be highly available on the cloud! Even better, GPU
                <i>memory</i> is tuned for bandwidth over raw latency, which
                only improves their throughput capabilities compared to a CPU.
                And by just playing with cloud cost calculators for a couple of
                minutes, it's clear that GPUs are cost-effective even on the
                major clouds.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be honest, I thought using GPUs for SQL processing would have
                taken off by now, but it hasn't. So, just over a year ago, I
                started working on actually deploying a cloud-based data
                platform powered by GPUs (i.e. Spark-RAPIDS), spurred by a
                friend-of-a-friend(-of-a-friend) who happened to have BigQuery
                cost concerns at his startup. After getting a proof of concept
                done and a letter of intent... well, nothing happened! Even
                after over half a year. But then, something magical did happen:
                their cloud credits ran out!
              </p>
              <p>
                And now, they're saving over 60% off of their BigQuery bill by
                using ParaQuery, while also being 2x faster -- with zero data
                migration needed (courtesy of Spark's GCS connector). By the
                way, I'm not sure about other people's experiences but... we're
                pretty far from being IO-bound (to the surprise of many
                engineers I've spoken to).
              </p>
              <p>
                I think that the future of high-throughput compute is computing
                on high-throughput hardware. If you think so too, or you have
                scaling data challenges, you can sign up here:
                <a href="https://paraquery.com/waitlist"
                  >https://paraquery.com/waitlist</a
                >. Sorry for the waitlist, but we're not ready for a self-serve
                experience just yet—it would front-load significant engineering
                and hardware cost. But we’ll get there, so stay tuned!
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks for reading! What have your experiences been with huge
                ETL / processing loads? Was cost or performance an issue? And
                what do you think about GPU acceleration (GPGPU)? Did you think
                GPUs were simply expensive? Would love to just talk about tech
                here!
