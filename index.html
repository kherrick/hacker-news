                It is an API to extract weather forecasting data from the
                National Blend of Models (NBM)
                <a href="https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/mdl/nbm"
                  >https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/mdl/nbm</a
                >
                and the Global Forecast System (GFS)
                <a
                  href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast"
                  >https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/gl...</a
                >
                . The data is freely available from AWS S3 in grib2 format which
                can be great but also really hard (and resource intensive) to
                work with, especially if you want to extract timeseries over
                long periods of time based on a few coordinates. Being able to
                query and extract only what you want out of terabytes of data in
                just an http request is really nice.
              </p>
              <p>
                What is cool about this dataset is that it has hourly data with
                full forecast history so you can use the dataset to train and
                forecast other parameters and have proper backtesting because
                you can see the weather "as of" points in time in the past. It
                has a free tier so you can play with it. There is a long list of
                upcoming features I intend to implement and I would very much
                appreciate both feedback on what is currently available and on
                what features you would be most interested in seeing. Like...
                I'm not sure if it would be better to support a few other
                datasets or focus on supporting aggregations.
              </p>
              <p>Features include:</p>
              <p>
                - A free tier to help you get started - Full history of weather
                forecasts - Extract timeseries for thousands of coordinates, for
                months at a time, at hourly resolution in a single http request
                taking only seconds. - Supports as-of/time-travel, indispensable
                for proper backtesting of derivative models - Automatic gap
                filling of any missing data with the next best (most recent)
                forecast.

                I'd like to share a fun project I've been working on: mizu.js.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's a js library that add functional attributes support into
                your html, designed to be a simple and flexible alternative to
                fully-fledged web frameworks (such as Vue, React, and Angular),
                while offering more capabilities than other lightweight options
                (like Alpine.js and htmx).
              </p>
              <p>
                As it's written using modern ES features and due to its
                isomorphic nature, it can be run in both browsers and runtimes
                (Node, Deno, Bun) without any changes. This makes it ideal for
                client-side and server-side rendering, as well as static site
                generation, whichever environment you prefer.

                Just include the script in any web page (or backend) to get
                started. You can template content, bind attributes, add
                interactivity, handle HTTP interactions, create custom
                components, and much more — all out of the box, without any
                configuration, transpilation steps, or builds.

              <p>## Motivation ##</p>
              <p>
                Nowadays, setting up a complete environment and installing
                thousands of packages is often required just to create a simple
                "Hello World" page. Yet, with the current ECMAScript standard,
                vanilla JS has never been more powerful. It offers built-in
                custom HTML components, proxies for changes tracking, weak
                references for better memory management, and many new data
                structures and methods.
              </p>
              <p>So why is web development still insanely complex?</p>
              <p>
                mizu.js aims to avoid adding bloat on top of native features,
                and instead focus on providing convenience helpers. It's
                basically "glue" around all these native features with added
                sugar, a recipe for a lightweight yet powerful utility.
              </p>
              <p>
                All evaluated expressions are interpreted as vanilla JavaScript,
                and you add your instructions directly into your HTML. So if you
                know already know about JS/HTML, then you're already 80% know of
                how to use mizu.js (add an extra 10% if you've used Vue,
                Alpine.js or htmx in the past as some syntax and concepts are
                inspired by it), the rest is basically just remembering the
                directive names. The learning curve is that small.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, you may have heard of
                <a href="https://matcha.mizu.sh">https://matcha.mizu.sh</a>, a
                CSS stylesheet to instantly make your web page stylized. Well,
                it's a great companion to mizu.js. With both of them, you can
                create MVPs for your projects super fast!
