              <p>
                A while back, I got frustrated with the state of accessible BCI
                hardware. Research gear was wildly unaffordable. So, I spent a
                ton of time designing a custom board, software and firmware to
                bridge that gap. I call it the Cerelog ESP-EEG. It is
                open-source (Firmware + Schematics), and I designed it
                specifically to fix the signal integrity issues found in most
                DIY hardware.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe in sharing the work. You can find the Schematics,
                Firmware, and Software setup on the GitHub repo: GITHUB LINK:
                <a href="https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/ESP-EEG"
                  >https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/ESP-EEG</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                For those who don't want to deal with BGA soldering or sourcing
                components, I do have assembled units available:
                <a href="https://www.cerelog.com/eeg_researchers.html"
                  >https://www.cerelog.com/eeg_researchers.html</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The major features: Forked/modified OpenBCI GUI Compatibility as
                well as Brainflow API, and LSL Compatibility. I know a lot of us
                rely on the OpenBCI GUI for visualization because it just works.
                I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so I ensured this board
                supports it natively.
              </p>
              <p>
                It works out of the box: I maintain a forked modified version of
                the GUI that connects to the board via LSL (Lab Streaming
                Layer). Zero coding required: You can visualize FFTs,
                Spectrograms, and EMG widgets immediately without writing a
                single line of Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "active bias" (why my signal is cleaner): The TI ADS1299 is
                the gold standard for EEG, but many dev boards implement it
                incorrectly. They often leave the Bias feedback loop "open"
                (passive), which makes them terrible at rejecting 60Hz mains
                hum. I simply followed the datasheet: I implemented a True
                Closed-Loop Active Bias (Drive Right Leg).
              </p>
              <p>
                How it works: It measures the common-mode signal, inverts it,
                and actively drives it back into the body. The result: Cleaner
                data
              </p>
              <p>Tech stack:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  ADC: TI ADS1299 (24-bit, 8-channel).

  MCU: ESP32 Chosen to handle high-speed SPI and WiFi/USB streaming

  Software: BrainFlow support (Python, C++, Java, C#) for those who want to build custom ML pipelines, LSL support, and forked version of OpenBCI GUI support
</code></pre>
              This was a huge project for me. I’m happy to geek out about
              getting the ESP32 to stream reliably at high sample rates as both
              the software and firmware for this project proved a lot more
              challenging than I expected. Let me know what you think!
              <p>
                SAFETY NOTE: I strongly recommend running this on a LiPo battery
                via WiFi. If you must use USB, please use a laptop running on
                battery power, not plugged into the wall.

                *Astroturfing:* Coordinated campaigns where accounts pose as
                students sharing "cheatsheets" and "predicted exam leaks." Other
                accounts then upvote, leave supportive comments, and ask
                follow-up questions—creating the illusion of organic student
                excitement. Multiple threads have exposed this pattern
                [1][2][3].
              </p>
              <p>
                *Paid fake posts:* High school students report being offered
                payment to write promotional Reddit posts [4].
              </p>
              <p>
                *Pressuring critics:* Users who post negative reviews report
                being contacted directly by company representatives, told it's
                "a shame" they're posting publicly [5]. Critical comments
                receive coordinated mass downvotes [6].
              </p>
              <p>
                *Soliciting copyrighted materials:* They use TikTok influencers
                and fake reddit posts to persuade students to sell them official
                IB exam papers, violating IB policies [7].
              </p>
              <p>The r/IBO moderators are actively investigating [8].</p>
              <p>
                These practices appear to be working great for them. Recently,
                they acquired OnePrep (oneprep.xyz), a free SAT prep tool that
                was already popular on r/sat. Since the acquisition, the same
                manipulation tactics have been deployed at scale: 150 Trustpilot
                reviews in a window of a few days [9], and widespread
                coordinated Reddit manipulation—multiple accounts posting "tips"
                that recommend Oneprep, coordinated upvoting, and fake
                enthusiasm in comments. The most prominent example was a 2,000+
                upvote post removed by moderators for manipulation, but it's
                part of a sustained campaign across the subreddit.

              <p>
                What - DoNotNotify is an app that logs all incoming
                notifications, and displays them grouped by app. It also
                captures the action behind the notification, which can be
                triggered from the app itself. From this log, you can create
                rules to whitelist/blacklist notifications from apps depending
                on their notification content. These filters can even be regex
                expressions, which allows for more complicated use-cases. The
                app ships with some pre-defined rules for popular apps like
                Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Netflix, TikTok, Reddit etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where - The website is at
                <a href="https://donotnotify.com/">https://donotnotify.com/</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Would also like to call out that the app runs purely on your
                device, never communicates with anything on the Internet, and
                only requires notifications access to work. It is completely
                free, and there is no advertising or hidden gotchas.

              <p>
                Circuit Artist is a game about drawing digital circuits as pixel
                art — like MS Paint, but pixels are wires and little triangles
                are NANDs. Hit play and the simulation runs in real time. It's
                fully white-box: every wire's state is visible.
              </p>
              <p>
                I launched it last year with a unit-delay simulation that ran
                until convergence on each update. It worked, but I realized it
                had some fundamental problems:
              </p>
              <p>
                (i) It hid what was actually happening. Players couldn't tell
                the difference between a ripple carry adder and a look-ahead
                adder — everything just resolved instantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                (ii) Design bugs became "game bugs." When players had
                non-converging wires (like A = not(A)), the game couldn't
                explain why or where the error was.
              </p>
              <p>
                (iii) Layout didn't matter. A NAND on one side of the map would
                instantly propagate to the opposite side, making spatial
                decisions meaningless. Unit delay probably works better for
                schematic-based simulators like Logisim, not a layout-focused
                game like this.
              </p>
              <p>
                (iv) Propagation visualization couldn't be added on top of the
                unit-delay engine — there was no notion of direction or
                distance.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I rebuilt the engine with variable-delay event-based
                simulation using an adaptation of Elmore delay. The delay for
                each wire depends on distance and fanout — longer wires are
                slower, higher fanout adds delay, branching wires are faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the implementation: I compute Elmore delay over wire trees.
                Each pixel has resistance and capacitance, with NAND inputs as
                nodes to account for fanout. For non-tree wire graphs, I build a
                Dijkstra-based spanning tree (driver as root) and interpolate
                for edges outside the tree. I calculate the delay for each node
                and project it back to the image so every pixel has a distance.
              </p>
              <p>
                This lets me animate propagation with a glow effect during
                simulation. The shader knows when each wire was triggered, the
                current time, and the Elmore distance of each pixel, so it
                resolves state per-pixel in real time.
              </p>
              <p>On top of that:</p>
              <p>
                - Time rewind: the simulation is now delta-based, so players can
                freeze and scrub backwards to debug. Super useful for cyclic
                circuits.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Layers: since timing matters now, I added up to 3 layers.
                NANDs only go on the bottom layer, upper layers propagate faster
                (lower capacitance). Lets you route wires above dense NAND
                areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game has a campaign for learning from scratch, though it's
                still incomplete and in progress. I'm working toward Steam
                Workshop support so people can create their own campaigns to
                teach different concepts or cover more advanced topics.
