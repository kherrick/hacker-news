                I prefer to learn how everything works and build something
                custom instead of just buying a premade kit and following
                instructions. I was wondering if there are any resources or
                books that we could go through together that would teach us the
                basics of electrical engineering and/or robotics.

              <p>
                We’re both physicists, and one of our biggest frustrations
                during grad school was finding research — There were a lot of
                times when we had to sit down to scope out new ideas for a
                project and quickly become a deep expert, or we had to find
                solutions to really complex technical problems, but the only way
                to do that was manually dig through papers on Google Scholar for
                hours. It was very tedious, to the point where we would often
                just skip the careful research and hope for the best. Sometimes
                you’d get burned a few months later because someone already
                solved the problem you thought was novel and important, or you’d
                waste your time inventing/building a solution for something when
                one already existed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem was there’s just no easy way to figure out what
                others have done in research, and load it into your brain. It’s
                one of the biggest bottlenecks for doing truly good, important
                research.
              </p>
              <p>
                We wanted to fix that. LLMs clearly help, but are mostly limited
                to general knowledge. Instead, we needed something that would
                pull in research papers, and give you exactly what you need to
                know, even for very complex ideas and topics. We realized the
                way to do this is to mimic the research strategies we already
                know work, because we do them ourselves, and so we built an
                agent-like LLM pipeline to carefully search in a way that mimics
                human research strategies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our search system works a bit differently from casual search
                engines. First, we have you chat back and forth with an LLM to
                make sure we actually understand your really complex research
                goals up front, like you’re talking to a colleague. Then the
                system carefully searches for you for ~3 minutes. At a high
                level, it does something similar to tree search, following
                citation rabbit holes and adapting based on what it discovers to
                look for more content over multiple iterations (the same way you
                would if you decided to spend a few hours). The 3 minute delay
                is annoying, but we’re optimizing for quality of results rather
                than latency right now. At the end there’s a report.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re trying to achieve two things with this careful, systematic
                agent-like discovery process:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. We want to be very accurate, and only recommend very specific
                results if you ask for a specific topic. To do this, we
                carefully read and evaluate content from papers with the highest
                quality LLMs (we’re just reading abstracts and citations for
                now, because they’re more widely accessible - but also working
                on adding full texts).
              </p>
              <p>
                2. We want to find everything relevant to your search, because
                in research it’s crucial to know if something exists or not. The
                key to being exhaustive is the adaptive algorithms we’ve
                developed (following citations, changing strategy based on what
                we find, etc). However, one cool feature of the automated
                pipeline is we can track the discovery process as the search
                proceeds. Early on, we find many good results, and later on they
                get more sparse, until all the good leads are exhausted and we
                stop finding anything helpful. We can statistically model that
                process, and figure out when we’ve found everything (it actually
                has an interesting exponential saturation behavior, which you
                can read a bit more about in our whitepaper (<a

              <p>
                All of this started when I realized that we only have 12,
                sometimes 13, full moon's in a year. That doesn’t seem like that
                many.
              </p>
              <p>
                I set out to build a MacOS app to remind me when a full moon
                occurs, so that I could take a moment and step outside to
                appreciate it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The MacOS app I ended up creating can be found at
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-moon/id6502374344"
                  >https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-moon/id6502374344</a
                >
                along with the source code [0], all powered by the Tiny Moon
                library.
              </p>
              <p>
                I knew that I wanted the app to work offline, so working with a
                network request was out of the picture. Taking inspiration from
                SunCalc [1] and Moontool for Windows [2], I decided to create my
                own library and wrote Tiny Moon as a Swift Package to power my
                app.
              </p>
              <p>
                The app tries to be as minimal as possible, does what it does
                very fast, and works completely offline.

              <p>
                Haystack was born out of our frustrations with working in large
                and mature codebases, specifically with navigating and editing
                functional flows (e.g. the code flow for adding an item to the
                Amazon shopping cart).
              </p>
              <p>
                Oftentimes dealing with such flows would involve navigating a
                maze of files and functions, and making any edits would involve
                a lengthy process of doing corresponding downstream/upstream
                plumbing.
              </p>
              <p>Haystack attempts to address this in the following ways:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>    1. It allows you to explore your codebase as a directed graph of functions, classes, etc on the canvas. We feel like this better fits how your mind understands your codebase and helps you find and alter functional flows more intuitively. We especially want to utilize this for pull request reviews!

    2. It has a navigational copilot that makes edits across files or functions much easier. After you make some changes, Haystack will try to predict your next action and create functions/methods or refactor upstream/downstream code for you. Haystack will surface these speculative edits on the canvas in a way that you can easily dismiss or incorporate them, allowing you to make large changes with a few clicks or keystrokes.

    3. Haystack will utilize natural language search so you don’t have to play “Where’s Waldo” to find a functional flow in your codebase. This is coming soon!

</code></pre>
              We’re still pretty early in development and we really want to
              perfect the experience of navigating and editing code on a canvas.
              Any feedback would be much appreciated!
              <p>
                PSA: Since Haystack is a VS Code fork, you should be able to
                move your extensions and keyboard shortcuts. Please let us know
                if you have any issues with this!

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                A few weeks ago we released the worlds fastest voice bot,
                achieving 500ms voice-to-voice response times, including a 200ms
                delay waiting for a user to stop speaking.
              </p>
              <p>
                After reaching the front page of HN, we thought about how we
                could take this a step further based on feedback we were getting
                from the community. Many companies were looking for a way to
                implement function calling and RAG with voice interfaces while
                retaining a low enough latency. We couldn’t find many resources
                about how to do this online that:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Allowed us to achieve sub-second voice-to-voice latency 2.
                Was more flexible than existing solutions. Vapi, Retell,
                [Bland.ai](<a href="http://Bland.ai">http://Bland.ai</a>) are
                too opinionated plus since they just orchestrate API’s which
                incur network latency at every step. See requirement above 3.
                The unit economics actually work at scale.
              </p>
              <p>So we decided to create a implementation of our own.</p>
              <p>Process:</p>
              <p>
                As we mentioned in our previous release, if you want to achieve
                response times this low you need to make everything as local as
                possible. So below was our setup
              </p>
              <p>
                - Local STT: Deepgram model - Local Embedding model: Nomic v1.5
                - Local VectorDB: Turso - Local LLM: Llama 3B - Local TTS:
                Deepgram model
              </p>
              <p>From our previous example, the only new components where:</p>
              <p>
                - Local Embedding model: We chose Nomic Embed text v1.5 model
                that gave a processing time of roughly ~200ms - Turso offers
                local embedded replicas combined with edgeDB’s which meant we
                were able to achieve 0.01 second read times. Pinecone also gave
                us good times of 0.043 seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                The above changes led us to achieve sub 1 second voice-to-voice
                response times
              </p>
              <p>Application:</p>
              <p>
                With Andrej Karpathy’s announcement around [Eureka Labs](<a
                  href="https://eurekalabs.ai/"
                  >https://eurekalabs.ai/</a
                >), a new AI+Education company we thought we would create our
                very own personalised Andrej tutor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Listen to anyone of his Youtube lectures, as soon as your start
                specking, the video will pause and he will reply. Once your
                question has been answered you can then tell him to continue
                with the lecture and the video will automatically start playing.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>For demo purposes:</p>
              <p>
                - We used OpenAI for GPT-4-mini and embeddings (its cheaper to
                run on a CPU than GPU’s when running demos at scale. These
                changes add about ~1 second to the response time - We used
                Eleven labs to clone his voice to make replies sound more
                realistic. This adds about 300ms to the response time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The improvements that can be made which we would like the
                community to contribute to are:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Embed the video screens as well that when you ask certain
                questions it can show you the relevant lecture slide for the
                same chuck that it got context from to answer. - Insert the
                timestamps in the vectorDB timestamps so that if a question will
                be answered later in the lecture he can let you know
              </p>
              <p>
                This unlocks so many use cases in education, employee training,
                sales etc that it would be great to see what the community
                builds!
