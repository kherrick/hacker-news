              <a href="https://www.litnerd.com">https://www.litnerd.com</a>).
              We’re a reading club for kids. It’s been two years since our first
              HN launch and I am back today to share some updates we're
              extremely excited about.
              <p>
                Litnerd is an online reading club program with a weekly live
                meetup to help students make reading a lifelong habit. Think of
                us as “book club meets gaming”. New books go live weekly, and
                each book has movie adaptations, music, reading courseware, mini
                lessons with a virtual teacher and worksheets. There are reading
                tournaments every month to recognize the top reader. The goal of
                our app is to create a fun and engaging way of cultivating a
                child’s natural curiosity by bringing the subject matter to life
                (movie adaptation of books with real actors, cartoon animation,
                enacted experiences) and through gamification—our community is
                obsessed with earning “Litcoin” (yup, we actually did this and
                it really works!) and winning monthly tournaments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a video that shows how Litnerd works:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSVjWi-rE8k"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSVjWi-rE8k</a
                >. Here’s a video I made for parents, summarizing what’s new
                with our product:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mniVUWx6tvM"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mniVUWx6tvM</a
                >, and here is an older video that gives you a quick demo:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wdk9ofb5w"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wdk9ofb5w</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we did our Launch HN back in 2021 (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28300640"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28300640</a
                >), we got two prominent themes of feedback. One was B2C
                access—you asked us to open the app for parents to buy directly
                rather than selling it only to schools. The other was that it
                gave you massive Diamond Age vibes. I read the Diamond Age. It
                gave me chills. Thank you!
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally, Litnerd was only sold to schools, and teachers had
                to administer the product in classroom time. We were also
                streaming live actors into the classroom to reenact books and
                build interest and fun.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, our program is a standalone web app used by both schools
                and parents (B2C access is live—thanks HN!) We no longer stream
                live actors into classrooms, but rather have films and cartoons
                in-app to bring the book to life, all filmed in our Brooklyn
                studio. We also have original soundtracks for each book, in both
                the app and on Spotify.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our product is now used by kids primarily after school hours—and
                the average kid is spending 30 minutes in the app daily! Parents
                in our first B2C cohort commented on how this is the only
                educational app their child wants to use without being pushed by
                a parent/teacher. With just 4 months of Litnerd usage, students
                improved comprehension by 72% and phonics improvement by 48%.
                Your child is auto-enrolled in a cohort when they sign up. They
                are also auto-enrolled in the current reading tournament of the
                month. The goal is to earn the most amount of Litcoin so that
                you can win tournaments and go shopping in the Litnerd Store. To
                earn Litcoin, your child does 3 things. First, they complete at
                least 15 minutes of daily reading. Second, they have daily
                reading tasks, such as quizzes and worksheets to build
                vocabulary and comprehension. Third, they attend a weekly live
                (virtual) meetup with their cohort.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why a live meetup? The Litnerd Reading Club is a
                <i>community</i> experience with a weekly meetup (if you miss
                the weekly meetup, you miss out on a lot of Litcoin earning
                potential). This ensures kids using the app feel like they are
                in a classroom or pod experience. Each child is entered into a
                cohort when they enroll, and each week your child will meet
                virtually with other kids in their cohort and discuss the book
                they are reading with our special guest (which might be the
                author of the book, an actor from the movie adaptation of the
                book, a literacy coach, etc). Here is a video to show what
                happens in these cohort sessions:

              <p>
                We have so much more to build out our version of the Primer from
                Diamond Age and inspire millions of kids, just like Nell, to
                fall in love with learning. We are working on turning the entire
                app into a game-ux interface, where kids can explore different
                cities in the app and read books/go through materials at their
                own pace and that the app will adapt to their interests. We also
                have our eye on adding other subjects and older grades in the
                future.
              </p>
              <p>
                As always, I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how
                you foster reading amongst your children! I am excited to hear
                your feedback and ideas to help us inspire the next generation
                of readers.

              of reports for startups.
              <p>
                After a year of building our product we tried to monetise and
                failed. Our free users weren’t willing to pay us money for
                individual reports.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among the users we had, there were a handful of later stage B2B
                companies with few customers but a lot of revenue (one had 50
                customers and $1m in annual revenue). These companies looked at
                their analytics in a different way. They cared a lot more about
                specific individual users than consumer apps do, and they spent
                a lot of time using our product.
              </p>
              <p>
                After learning this we spent some time trying to understand the
                differences between product analytics for a B2C product versus a
                B2B one. We learned three main things that led us to pivot our
                company into building a product analytics tool for B2B SaaS
                companies:
              </p>
              <p>
                (1) Most of the revenue in B2B products comes from a handful of
                customers. In Slack’s case, 500 customers out of 700,000 made up
                to 40% of revenue[1]! (2) Most of the revenue B2B products make
                comes from expansion. Contracts start small and grow over time,
                as a company wins more trust and delivers value. This means that
                growing product usage among existing users, over time, draws in
                more users and more revenue. (3) Product management in B2B is a
                lot less quantitative than in B2C. It is more a collaboration
                with Sales and Customer Success teams. The kind of insights you
                need from analytics are different. You need to know “Are our key
                customers adopting the new feature we launched?” and not “Does
                our new redesign improve activation by 2%?”
              </p>
              <p>
                After learning these things we went back to the drawing board
                and rebuilt our product with them in mind. That is, we built a
                product analytics tool that (1) has automatically set up reports
                that allow you to track acquisition, activation, retention and
                feature usage; (2) supports measuring metrics both in terms of
                how many users or companies use your product; and (3) helps you
                answer common questions for your users like “Who used our
                product the most in the last 90 days?”, “Who tried our new
                feature once and never came back?”, “What’s our feature with the
                highest retention? How many people use it?”
              </p>
              <p>
                This realization happened a year ago and we’ve now reached the
                point where more than a thousand B2B SaaS companies at seed and
                Series A use us every month.
