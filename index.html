              <p>The Problem</p>
              <p>
                It’s been almost a year since we’ve finished YC, and we’ve just
                crossed 100,000 multinode training GPU hours run on our
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                On those training runs, we’ve seen countless 3am job crashes
                because of issues like an Xid error from a flaky GPU or an S3
                timeout that corrupted a checkpoint save. By the time you wake
                up and notice, you've lost 8+ hours of compute. You scramble to
                diagnose the issue, manually restart from the last checkpoint,
                and hope it doesn't happen again. Rinse and repeat.
              </p>
              <p>
                For training runs that take days to weeks, this constant
                babysitting is exhausting and expensive. The research iteration
                cycles lost can also make or break a model release (especially
                for short reservations).
              </p>
              <p>What We Built</p>
              <p>
                This agent monitors your training jobs and autonomously recovers
                them when things go wrong. It works with Kubernetes, Slurm, and
                TensorPool Jobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                We originally built the TensorPool Agent as an internal tool to
                help us debug failures with our own customers. Over time, we
                realized its performance was so good that we could automate the
                entire triage process. We're now releasing a public beta for
                people to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Best case: The TensorPool Agent detects the failure, diagnoses
                the root cause, fixes it, and restarts your job from the last
                checkpoint – all while you sleep ;)
              </p>
              <p>
                Worst case: If the TensorPool agent can't fix the issue
                automatically, it delivers a preliminary RCA and a list of
                actions it attempted, giving you a head start on debugging.
              </p>
              <p>How It Works</p>
              <p>
                1) Registration – You provide credentials to your job scheduler
                via our dashboard. Perms are granted on a whitelist basis; you
                explicitly control what actions the agent can take.
              </p>
              <p>
                2) Monitoring – The agent continuously monitors your job for
                failure conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                3) Recovery – On failure, the agent analyzes logs and attempts
                to diagnose the issue. If successful, it restarts the job from
                the last checkpoint and resumes monitoring. If not, you get an
                alert with full context.
              </p>
              <p>Target Failure Modes</p>
              <p>
                The agent is specifically designed for runtime errors that occur
                deep into training, like:
              </p>
              <p>- CUDA OOM: Memory leaks, gradient explosions</p>

              <a href="https://agentmail.to">https://agentmail.to</a>), the
              email inbox API for agents. We’re not talking about AI for your
              email, this is email for your AI.
              <p>
                Email is an optimal interface for long-running agents. It’s
                multithreaded and asynchronous with full support for rich text
                and files. It’s a universal protocol with identity and
                authentication built in. Moreover, a lot of workflow critical
                context already lives in email.
              </p>
              <p>
                We wanted to build email agents that you can forward your work
                to and get back a completed task. The agents could act entirely
                autonomously as you wouldn't need to delegate your identity. If
                they did get stuck they could just send you, or anyone else, an
                email.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using Gmail, we kept getting stuck on the limitations of their
                API. No way to create inboxes programmatically. Rate and sending
                limits. OAuth for every single inbox. Keyword search that
                doesn't understand context. Per-seat pricing that doesn't work
                for agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we built what we wished existed: an email provider for
                developers. APIs for creating inboxes and configuring domains.
                Email parsing and threading. Text extraction from attachments.
                Realtime webhooks and websockets. Semantic search across
                inboxes. Usage-based pricing that works for agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developers, startups, and enterprises are already deploying
                email agents with AgentMail. Agents that convert conversations
                and documents into structured data. Agents that source quotes,
                negotiate prices, and get the best deals. Agents that emulate
                internet users for training models on end-to-end tasks.

                We run it through a small Swedish company. We pay artists,
                handle logistics, and take operations seriously. But it has
                still behaved like a tiny cultural startup in the most relevant
                way: you have to build trust, form a recognisable identity, pace
                yourself, avoid burnout, and make something people genuinely
                return to, without big budgets or growth hacks. We run it on the
                last Friday of every month in a small restaurant venue,
                typically 50–70 paying guests.
              </p>
              <p>
                What we built isn’t an app. It’s a repeatable local format: a
                standing night where strangers become regulars, centred on music
                rather than networking.
              </p>
              <p>
                We put up a simple anchor site with schedule + photos/video:
                <a href="https://kolibrinkpg.com/">https://kolibrinkpg.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>What you can “try” on the site:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  * Photos and short videos from nights (atmosphere + scale)
  * A sense of programming/curation (what we book, how we sequence a night)
  * Enough context to copy parts of the format if you’re building something similar locally
</code></pre>
              How it started: almost accidentally. I was doing one of many
              remote music sessions with a friend from London, passing Ableton
              projects back and forth while talking over FaceTime. One evening I
              ran out of beer and wandered into a nearby restaurant (Mitropa). A
              few conversations later we had a date on the calendar.
              <p>
                That restaurant is still the venue. It’s owned by a local
                family: one runs the kitchen, another manages the space. Over
                time they’ve become close to us, so I’ll put it plainly: if they
                called and needed help, we’d drop everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maria was quickly dubbed klubbvärdinnan (hostess), partly as a
                joke. In Sweden in the 1970s, posh nightclubs sometimes had a
                klubbvärdinna, a kind of social anchor. She later adopted it as
                her DJ alias, and the role became real: greeting people,
                recognising newcomers who look uncertain, and quietly setting
                the tone for how people treat one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                The novelty (if there is any) is that we treat the night like a
                designed social system:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  * Curation is governance. If the music is coherent and emotionally “true”, people relax. If it’s generic, people perform.
  * The room needs a host layer. Someone has to make it socially safe to arrive alone.
  * Regulars are made, not acquired. People return when they feel recognised and when the night has a consistent identity.
  * DIY constraints create legitimacy. Turning a corner restaurant into a club on a shoestring sounds amateurish, but it reads as real.
  * Behavioural boundaries are practical. If newcomers can’t trust the room, the whole thing stops working.
</code></pre>
              On marketing: we learned quickly that “posting harder” isn’t the
              same as building a local thing. What worked best was analogue
              outreach: we walked around town, visited local businesses we
              genuinely like, bought something, introduced ourselves, and asked
              if we could leave a flyer. It’s boring, but it builds trust
              because it’s human, not algorithmic.
              <p>
                A concrete example: early on we needed Instagram content that
                could show music visually without filming crowds in a club. We
                started filming headphone-walk clips: one person, headphones on,
                walking through town to a track we chose. It looked good,
                stylised, cinematic, and that mattered more than we expected.
                People didn’t just tolerate being filmed; many wanted to be in
                the videos. Then we’d invite them for a couple of free drinks
                afterwards as a thank-you and a chance to actually talk. That
                was a reliable early trust-building mechanism.
              </p>
              <p>
                At one point we were offered a larger venue with a proper
                budget. It was tempting. But we’d just hosted our first live gig
                at Mitropa and felt something click. We realised the format
                works because it’s small and grounded. Scale would change the
                social physics.
