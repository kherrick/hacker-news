                Hi HN! We’re Bolu and Noah from AnswerGrid (<a
                  href="https://answergrid.ai"
                  >https://answergrid.ai</a
                >). We’re building an AI-powered web research tool in the form
                of a spreadsheet. The problem we’re starting with is helping
                founders who sell to businesses discover the most relevant leads
                worth the investment of manual outbound (that is, worth putting
                in the effort to write a personalized outreach message to see if
                they might be interested).
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                One of the biggest problems B2B founders have, once they’ve
                built an initial product, is finding initial companies to sell
                to. There’s a chicken-and-egg problem here: most companies don’t
                want to buy from a startup until it’s much further along, but
                the startup won’t get that far unless they find some customers.
                Locating those first companies who need what you’re building
                badly enough that they’ll go with you at an early stage is
                time-consuming and painful - you’re searching a haystack for a
                few needles. This is the problem we’re building software to help
                solve.
              </p>
              <p>
                We found that for effective lead qualification—that is,
                narrowing down the haystack of potential companies to a few
                highly relevant ones—you can’t just search on keywords or
                industry categories like "AI," "Hardware," or "Healthcare" on
                other lead generation indexes. Those methods are too blunt to
                find adopters for an early product that almost necessarily has a
                narrow initial appeal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, you’d need to evaluate companies using many loose
                heuristics. For example, one of our early customers qualifies
                leads with questions like, "Do they offer subscription or
                usage-based pricing?" Most existing lead generation tools have
                forced founders to choose between thoughtful qualification
                research and increasing the reach of their high-quality
                outbound.
              </p>
              <p>
                We found a few existing tools to wrangle CSV exports with
                additional AI qualifications, but nothing seemed built to help
                first-time founders like ourselves find the first couple of
                hyper-relevant companies to sell to. Their feature sets and
                advertised use cases (like "AI-written personalized messages")
                seemed optimized for scaling the go-to-market of a
                <i>mature</i> product—a completely different situation. This led
                us to focus on making lead gen intuitive for other builders
                selling for the first time, looking to find their early users.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve built a tool to help founders codify the research
                heuristics they use to qualify leads that justify a
                time-consuming investment in human-written outreach. (Side note:
                while we’re using AI to help qualify leads, we emphatically do
                <i>not</i> want to help scale AI spam. Our tool aims to help you
                discover potential users worth writing to manually.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s how it works: Starting from lead-gen sources like
                Crunchbase, Apollo, and LinkedIn as a data foundation, we find
                leads that match a simple high-level company profile: “Series A
                Biotech startups in the US.” You can then further qualify leads
                using AI-powered tools such as (1) “web scrape,” which, when
                given a target URL column, spawns concurrent jobs to scrape
                (text and screenshots) the target sites of all companies in the
                table and returns LLM evaluations based on a prompt; and (2)
                “web search,” which returns answers and citations to natural
                language questions using information from the web.
              </p>
              <p>
                These tools afford a greater level of expressiveness than simple
                keyword searches. We aspire for the tool to match the
                thoroughness a founder would apply manually on any given lead.
                But this time, help them do it for thousands of leads at a go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you’ve narrowed prospects down with these granular
                qualifications, you can then use job descriptions to find the
                contact information of your potential customer champions.
              </p>
              <p>
                While we’re excited about other web research use cases, we
                started with sales qualification because the research outcome is
                immediately actionable—" Who should I sell to today?"—and the
                feedback cycles are short—"Was that lead relevant?”.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are exploring exposing our web research infrastructure
                through an API to other developers who'd find it helpful to
                enable web research workflows in their apps. Please reach out
                (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/AnswerGrid-15"
                  >https://tinyurl.com/AnswerGrid-15</a
                >) if you’re working on a product that might benefit from this.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can try the tool here:

              </p>
              <p>
                We’re excited to hear about any lead qualification tricks you’ve
                discovered for identifying your early users or what other use
                cases you think are relevant here. Even if you’re not looking to
                do lead generation, any product feedback from playing with the
                demo would still be most appreciated.
              </p>
              <p>
                * A Note on how the Search box works: It tries to infer the
                starting Crunchbase filter configs based on your query. If it
                doesn’t get the configs precisely, you can edit the inferred
                filters at the top left corner once the grid is loaded, or try
                starting with a more straightforward query before adding extra
                LLM qualification columns.

                Building modern apps these days involves a lot of schleps. For a
                basic CRUD app you need to spin up servers, wire up endpoints,
                integrate auth, add permissions, and then marshal data from the
                backend to the frontend and back again. If you want to deliver a
                buttery smooth user experience, you’ll need to add optimistic
                updates and rollbacks. We do these steps over and over for every
                feature we build, which can make it difficult to build
                delightful software. Could it be better?

                We were senior and staff engineers at Facebook and Airbnb and
                had been thinking about this problem for years. In 2021, Stopa
                wrote an essay talking about how these schleps are actually
                database problems in disguise [1]. In 2022, Stopa wrote another
                essay sketching out a solution with a Firebase-like database
                with support for relations [2]. In the last two years we got the
                backing of James Tamplin (CEO of Firebase), became a team of 5
                engineers, pushed almost ~2k commits, and today became open
                source.

              <p>Making a chat app in Instant is as simple as</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>    function Chat() {
      // 1. Read
      const { isLoading, error, data } = useQuery({
        messages: {},
      });
    
      // 2. Write
      const addMessage = (message) =&gt; {
        transact(tx.messages[id()].update(message));
      }
    
      // 3. Render!
      return &lt;UI data={data} onAdd={addMessage} /&gt;
    }
</code></pre>
              Instant gives you a database you can subscribe to directly in the
              browser. You write relational queries in the shape of the data you
              want and we handle all the data fetching, permission checking, and
              offline caching. When you write transactions, optimistic updates
              and rollbacks are handled for you as well.
              <p>
                Under the hood we save data to postgres as triples and wrote a
                datalog engine for fetching data [3]. We don’t expect you to
                write datalog queries so we wrote a graphql-like query language
                that doesn’t require any build step.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taking inspiration from Asana’s WorldStore and Figma’s
                LiveGraph, we tail postgres’ WAL to detect novelty and use
                last-write-win semantics to handle conflicts [4][5]. We also
                handle websocket connections and persist data to IndexDB on web
                and AsyncStorage for React Native, giving you multiplayer and
                offline mode for free.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the kind of infrastructure Linear uses to power their
                sync and build better features faster [6]. Instant gives you
                this infrastructure so you can focus on what’s important:
                building a great UX for your users, and doing it quickly. We
                have auth, permissions, and a dashboard with a suite tools for
                you to explore and manage your data. We also support ephemeral
                capabilities like presence (e.g. sharing cursors) and broadcast
                (e.g. live reactions) [7][8].

              <p>
                We have a free hosted solution where we don’t pause projects, we
                don’t limit the number of active applications, and we have no
                restrictions for commercial use. We can do this because our
                architecture doesn’t require spinning up a separate servers for
                each app. When you’re ready to grow, we have paid plans that
                scale with you. And of course you can self host both the backend
                and the dashboard tools on your own.

              <a href="https://arva-ai.com">https://arva-ai.com</a>). Arva uses
              an AI agent to automate the manual verification that every
              banking/fintech does when they get a new business customer. This
              is called “Know Your Business” compliance (KYB for short) and it’s
              a royal pain.
              <p>
                There’s a demo video here:
                <a href="https://www.arva-ai.com/loom"
                  >https://www.arva-ai.com/loom</a
                >
                , and if you’re curious to try it out for yourself, you can
                onboard onto ‘Arva Bank’ and see what happens when you upload
                some fake documents:
                <a href="https://platform.arva-ai.com/demo"

              </p>
              <p>
                What’s this about? When a business onboards onto a bank or
                fintech (i.e. applies to be a customer), a human analyst has to
                conduct extensive manual verification a lot of the time. This
                causes long onboarding times, and there are huge costs in
                maintaining compliance teams and in fixing mistakes—because
                human analysts often deviate from procedure.
              </p>
              <p>
                I (Rhim) formerly led the FinCrime product team at Revolut
                Business. There were hundreds (!) of KYB analysts conducting
                tens of thousands of manual reviews per day! Turns out this is
                the same across pretty much all fintechs in all jurisdictions
                around the world, and it’s a problem that can now largely be
                solved by a combination of AI, data and business logic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the manual verification work falls into three
                categories: document verification (e.g. articles of
                incorporation); figuring out the business activities (e.g. does
                the business do things that are allowed); and communication with
                the customer (to make sure they provide the correct pieces of
                information).
              </p>
              <p>
                Handling all of this for a customer is time consuming. It leads
                to huge compliance overheads from having a manual team, which
                can also often make scaling very difficult. Days of
                back-and-forth over email with customers creates a terrible
                experience, leading to drop off and hence revenue loss. In fact,
                in the US, slow customer onboarding costs fintechs $10B annually
                in lost revenue (<a
                  href="https://resources.fenergo.com/newsroom/poor-customer-experience-costs-financial-institutions-10-billion-per-year"

                structured and formalized that it turns out to be a good match
                for the current generation of AI tools.

                Enter Arva AI. We've built a highly compliant AI agent that
                instantly handles all low/medium risk manual KYB work in
                real-time as a customer is onboarding, cutting reviews to
                seconds and ops spend by 80%. Arva AI’s agent can operate
                globally and can either be used as standalone KYB agent, or
                layered into already implemented compliance stacks. We focus on
                reviewing documentation, websites and social profiles in
                realtime and then communicating with the customer so that they
                can rectify bad information whilst they’re in the onboarding
                flow.

                It supports the COFF and ELF object file formats, for the x86
                and MIPS architectures. It has been successfully used on Linux,
                Windows and PlayStation executables. One user report is on a
                commercial video game from 2009 with a ~7 MiB Windows executable
                written in C++: it was delinked without its C runtime library
                and then relinked into a new executable at a different base
                address, with no visible change in functionality, as a prelude
                to a decompilation project.

                Use-cases I've demonstrated on my blog include modding, making
                software ports, converting executable file formats, creating
                libraries... I've originally built this as part of a video game
                decompilation project ; I've been working on this over the past
                2.5 years and recently it has started gaining some users besides
                me.

              <p>
                Hello HN, I'm excited to share a project I've been working on
                called VirtualStorageLibrary. It's a .NET library designed to
                manage in-memory tree structures, including items, directories,
                and symbolic links.
              </p>
              <p>
                VirtualStorageLibrary is a .NET library that operates entirely
                in-memory and provides a tree-structured collection. This
                library offers a foundation for managing hierarchical data
                structures, supporting items, directories, and symbolic links
                that encapsulate user-defined types &lt;T&gt; (generic types
                defined by the user). This library is not a file system.
                Instead, it was redesigned from scratch to create a more
                flexible and user-friendly tree structure. The library aims to
                make it intuitive to reference, traverse, and manipulate nodes
                by specifying paths.
              </p>
              <p>
                The collections provided by .NET are linear, including types
                like hash sets, arrays, lists, and dictionaries, which
                inherently have a linear structure (such as arrays and lists).
                In contrast, common file systems can be viewed as tree-shaped
                collections, where elements are managed as nodes in a
                hierarchical structure. While there are existing libraries that
                support tree-shaped collections, I couldn’t find one that models
                a file system-like structure. Therefore, I conceptualized a
                logical interpretation of a file system and asked, "Can we
                implement a tree collection purely as objects?" The goal was to
                create a system that can flexibly manage hierarchical and allow
                intuitive access.
              </p>
              <p>Key Features:</p>
              <p>
                Flexible Tree Structure Hierarchical structure based on
                parent-child relationships, enabling flexible node management.
              </p>
              <p>
                Various Nodes Items, directories, and symbolic links, including
                user-defined types &lt;T&gt;.
              </p>
              <p>
                Intuitive Node Operations via Paths API for referencing,
                searching, adding, deleting, renaming, copying, and moving nodes
                using paths.
              </p>
              <p>
                Link Management Symbolic links managed with a link dictionary,
                tracking changes in target paths.
              </p>
              <p>
                Circular Reference Prevention Detects and prevents circular
                references in paths involving symbolic links by throwing an
                exception.
              </p>
              <p>
                Flexible Node List Retrieval Retrieves node lists within
                directories, filtered, grouped, and sorted by specified node
                types and attributes.
              </p>

              <p>
                The current version is 0.8.0 (prerelease). As of 2024/08, all
                essential features for version 1.0.0 have been implemented.
                However, some bug fixes, around 30 feature improvements, and
                refactoring tasks remain. With version 0.8.0, we aim to gather
                user feedback, including bug reports and feature enhancement
                suggestions. Simultaneously, we plan to work through the
                remaining tasks for version 0.9.0, targeted for release in
                October 2024. During this period, class names, method names,
                property names, and other elements in the library may change,
                merge, or be deprecated without notice. Detailed information
                will be provided in the release notes, so please check them for
                updates.
              </p>
