                >https://certainlyhealth.com/</a
              >), a marketplace that lets you shop for doctors and compare your
              out-of-pocket costs upfront (currently only in NYC). Using each
              patient's insurance and machine learning, we predict and guarantee
              out-of-pocket costs to prevent surprise bills.
              <p>
                We grew up in immigrant families, and for both of us, our
                parents would honestly tell us to not trust doctors because of
                unexpected medical bills. They really believed that doctors were
                adding on unnecessary things that didn’t help in order to make
                more money. As adults, we’ve both had first-hand experiences
                receiving surprise bills even with good insurance while working
                at tech companies, so solving this problem is personal to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out 38% of Americans delay medical care for fear of the
                bill while prices vary 2-10x across health providers, even when
                using insurance. This led us to believe that creating a
                marketplace with transparent out-of-pocket costs could be a
                solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it wasn’t until the July 2022 Transparency in Coverage
                Rule (<a
                  href="https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency"
                  >https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency</a
                >) that we had the payer pricing data (that’s actually high
                quality compared to hospital data) to create this marketplace.
                Certainly is the first company to use this data to predict and
                guarantee prices for consumers to book doctors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know the HN community has been interested in applications of
                healthcare price transparency data (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32738783"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32738783</a
                >), so we’re excited to share how we’re using this data to
                predict and guarantee prices for a consumer application.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Certainly, patients can enter their insurance, compare
                guaranteed out-of-pocket costs across doctors, and book an
                appointment with price transparency. For providers, we guarantee
                any patient we send them will always pay. Partner providers pay
                us any time we send them a new patient. Eventually, we’ll
                convert providers to using our SaaS platform to guarantee
                payments from existing patients.

                We are currently focused on shoppable services - anything that
                can be scheduled in advance. Our solution falls between two ends
                of the spectrum for consumer shopping experiences. At one end is
                healthcare, where the status quo is you go to a doctor and you
                have no idea what will happen and you have no idea how much it
                will cost. At the other end is going to a restaurant, having a
                menu of items with corresponding prices, and deciding which
                items you want to order.
              </p>
              <p>
                Certainly Health lets you see what services could happen during
                your visit and how much they will cost. We guarantee that if
                those services happen, you will not pay more than the
                out-of-pocket costs you saw upfront for each of those services.
                But it is ultimately the doctor who decides which services you
                end up getting (like a chef deciding which dishes you will be
                served). As a result, you can compare upfront out-of-pocket
                costs specific to your insurance and book a provider without
                worrying about surprise bills.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common misconception is that patient out-of-pocket costs are
                set by doctors. Prices of healthcare services are actually the
                result of negotiations between providers and insurance
                companies. Groups with more negotiating power, like large
                hospital systems, are able to command higher rates than private
                practice physicians. This variance in cost is enormous across
                almost all procedures we've looked at, even between providers a
                few blocks from each other. It might cost $105 to get an
                orthopedic consultation with one doctor, and $550 to get a
                consultation with another doctor across the street, for example.
                This price variance means the out-of-pocket cost also varies for
                patients with high deductible plans or plans where the copay
                does not cover all services (which we’ve encountered very
                often).
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not use hospital price data which is inconsistent and
                messy (<a
                  href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/analysis-inconsistencies-within-hospital-price-transparency-data-make-cost-comparisons-difficult/"
                  >https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/analysis-inco...</a
                >). Instead, our guaranteed prices are based on three things:
                (1) health insurance published rates for procedures, as required
                by regulation; (2) patient eligibility/benefits information
                (e.g. deductible, copay, coinsurance); and (3) an online
                learning model to account for variance across thousands of plans
                and patient conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we process payments and claims, we create an accurate
                platform for predicting out-of-pocket costs by accounting for
                variations such as whether certain procedures are covered by an
                insurance plan/copay, and how the rate changes based on
                diagnosis code (we discovered V97.33XD is for "Sucked into jet
                engine, subsequent encounter”), number of units, medical coding
                modifiers, and other factors.
              </p>

                from over 5k doctors to book without surprise bills for free at

                  >https://certainlyhealth.com/</a
                >. We plan to expand to other cities once we prove that we can
                establish a low CAC on both the supply and demand sides in NYC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although we’re early, we’re starting to see intended results.
                One patient saved $850 on a podiatrist visit booked through us
                compared to a previous visit with a different doctor for the
                exact same services. Another was charged for an annual physical,
                but we identified the mistake and got a refund issued to him.
                Most of our customers have had surprise bills in the past and
                are happy to have peace of mind with our upfront, guaranteed
                prices.
              </p>

                We’d love to hear your ideas, experiences, feedback and any
                feature requests!

              <a href="https://tiptap.dev/">https://tiptap.dev/</a>), an open
              source developer toolkit for building collaborative editing apps.
              Our editor framework, based on ProseMirror, is at
              <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap"
                >https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap</a

              >.
              <p>
                Building editor interfaces like Notion or Google Docs in your
                web app takes a lot of work and time. Our open source tools and
                cloud services let you build collaborative content editing
                faster—in days or weeks, rather than months or years. And this
                is just for the editor. If you want real-time collaboration or
                other advanced features like version history in your editor, the
                overall workload quickly escalates—you will need a robust and
                serious backend infrastructure that requires even more time to
                set up and maintain. This doesn’t make sense for most frontend
                developers or most startups.
              </p>
              <p>
                We spent eight years as a digital agency developing applications
                with complex content editing functionality. We learned the hard
                way how limited the existing editors were. After building Tiptap
                as a headless editor framework with an extension-based
                architecture, we needed to allow multiple users to edit content
                simultaneously, which got complicated. There was no simple
                solution that could be integrated quickly. So we built that too.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Tiptap editor is based on the JS framework ProseMirror,
                which is a good foundation for editors. The learning curve for
                ProseMirror is steep because it's complicated to understand and
                lacks simple APIs and documentation. It takes a lot of code
                around ProseMirror to develop a modern user experience. We’ve
                taken care of that for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tiptap is headless, so it will work with whatever frontend or
                design you have in mind—we make no assumptions about your UI.
                You can use it to develop block-based editors like Notion,
                classic interfaces like Google Docs, or whatever you need. It's
                also framework agnostic, so you can use it with React, Vue,
                etc., or vanilla JavaScript. And it's highly customizable
                through our extension architecture. We also provide an API to
                access ProseMirror's internals through Tiptap if you want to dig
                deep into the core.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adding real-time collaboration to your editor is as easy as
                installing and configuring an extension. Our collaboration
                backend, called Hocuspocus, uses Yjs. This is a widely used
                implementation of CRDTs (conflict- free replicated data type).
                Hocuspocus makes it easy to set up a Node.js websocket server to
                handle communication between multiple peers to synchronize data.
                Like the Tiptap editor, Hocuspocus is designed to be extensible
                according to your needs. Also, Hocuspocus can work independently
                of Tiptap with other editors like Lexical or Slate.
              </p>
              <p>
                An earlier version of Tiptap got discussed a couple years ago at
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901975"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901975</a
                >. We’ve been enjoying wider adoption since then. For example,
                Substack uses Tiptap for their editor that allows creators to
                write content on substack.com, and YC uses Tiptap in their
                Bookface forum (which is basically HN for YC alums).
              </p>
              <p>
                With the Tiptap Cloud, we offer managed backend services if you
                don't want to build and maintain every feature yourself. For
                real-time collaboration, we provide a cloud infrastructure with
                multiple datacenter regions where you can deploy Hocuspocus. The
                Tiptap AI integration beta is a service where you connect your
                OpenAI API key to our backend and install the Tiptap editor AI
                extension to get AI writing experience in your editor. Here’s a
                demo:
                <a href="https://ai-demo.tiptap.dev/"
                  >https://ai-demo.tiptap.dev/</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We invite you to explore Tiptap's capabilities in your app,
                contribute to its open source development, and (hopefully!) join
                our welcoming community. We'd love to hear what you've already
                built with Tiptap or what's stopping you from creating something
                with it :-) We look forward to all of your comments!
