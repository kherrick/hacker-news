              <i>any</i> problems to solve with these tools.
              <p>
                I could lock myself in an empty room for days and come up with
                <i>nothing</i>. I've been waiting for an "idea" to hit me for
                nearly 10 years, I don't use any open source software that I
                could contribute to at all, and I lack the creativity to come up
                with "just for fun" projects. I feel very stagnant and I just
                don't know how to move forward anymore. Am I just hard-wired to
                be mediocre?

                MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web
                crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products
                including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across
                industries including Recruiting, Finance, Security, Sales, and
                Marketing. The company was founded in 2011 and received
                investment from top-tier investors including Y Combinator and
                Mark Cuban.

                We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20
                countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no
                dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies
                and backgrounds are welcome.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming
                is not just a job but it's something they love to do. We're
                obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases,
                compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does
                this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have
                a fully-automated development environment and be pushing commits
                on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple
                times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Our codebase is
                written in Python, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, Rust, and Nix. To
                start working on our codebase, you'll need to be familiar with
                Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.
              </p>
              <p>
                We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate
                three datacenters with high performance servers we've built that
                are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process.
                We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do
                full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis
                on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are
                published. Unlike a typical company where you'll spend half of
                your time in meetings— at MixRank you'll get to direct your
                entire focus into difficult technical problems that will help
                you to grow as an individual.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't
                singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy
                on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the
                position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom
                role and responsibilities that are specialized to their
                interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of
                specific requirements for a position with the expectation that
                you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be
                the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements
                decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first
                get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then
                we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific
                talents.

              <p>Junior Software Engineer</p>
              <p>
                We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of
                professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity
                exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.
                This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse
                opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases,
                distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis,
                machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data
                mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight
                what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side
                projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ideally you've already finished with school, but if you still
                have one or more years left please feel free to apply anyway. If
                you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to
                accommodate your schedule.

              >) but I'm looking for a way to use Wifi for more general imaging.
              There's a paper from 2017 ("Holography of WiFi Radiation)[<a
                href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.183901"
                >https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.11...</a
              >] and many other scholarly papers about object detection via
              WiFi, but I haven't been able to find any off-the-shelf
              products/projects that would just build a 3D environmental density
              map without any object detection. The resolution doesn't have to
              be great - not looking for millimeter scale features e.g.
              structural weakness. Is there anything out there that comes close?
              Given recent archaeological uses of drone LIDAR and satellite
              tomography, I figure the software for interpreting this kind of
              data should be pretty robust by now, just maybe it hasn't filtered
              down to the consumer market.
