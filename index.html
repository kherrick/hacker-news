              trying to make it as easy as possible to translate software into
              other languages using LLMs. Here’s a demo:

                Internationalizing/localizing is hard. You have to comb through
                your whole app and look for what needs to be translated and
                manually update your translations every time new stuff gets
                added. People sometimes hire their own in-house translators, or
                they send off their translations to humans to be translated,
                which takes days, weeks, or worse and costs a ton.
                Internationalization is, of course, super important for user
                growth and retention, and often neglected until very late, when
                competitors will make your product for LATAM, APAC, or Europe.

                I worked at Slack for three years on the Slack Connect team,
                building features like Shared Channels and Shared Workspaces,
                which had millions of users all over the world. Our translation
                system was slow and painful, often delaying product launches
                when things were added last-minute, and resulted in context-less
                and inconsistent translations. Words like "duplicate" could be
                either an action or a state, depending on if it's in a button or
                just displaying a status, and words like "Huddles" were
                translated ten different ways by translators who just wanted to
                get through as many translations as possible as quickly as
                possible, hindering adoption and confusing users.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a parallel universe, but in the same Downtown Oakland
                apartment, Brendan worked at a retail startup from the founder
                of Woot, acquired by Amazon, and they brought someone in to
                manually translate their product into Spanish, which was
                expensive and took months. Even worse, the translations had to
                be manually ported over by engineers every time they updated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Brendan and I have been coding together since fourth grade,
                starting by making Cydia tweaks on iOS 4, building apps like one
                of the first Dogecoin wallets (DogeTicker) in ninth grade, and
                running small businesses fixing computers and making websites.
                When we realized we both had miserable translation experiences,
                we decided to work together to make these approaches a thing of
                the past!
              </p>
              <p>
                Our solution to these problems is multiple. Firstly, we utilize
                a custom Babel plugin to traverse the AST and search for
                user-facing strings that should be translated, eliminating the
                need to manually comb through the application and gather
                strings. During builds, we also utilize the AST to provide
                context to the LLMs on any new text which is then used to give
                correct translations for different use cases, (e.g. “Duplicate —
                is it in a button, where it’s a verb, or is in a regular string,
                where it’s a noun?)
              </p>
              <p>
                After scanning for strings and wrapping them in functions to
                display correct translations to the user based on their browser
                locale, we gather these strings and build time, and submit new
                strings to be translated and bring in recently translated
                strings. During translation, we take both the context and
                similar strings to guarantee consistency. Translation itself
                using our LLMs only takes a few seconds, rather than days
                utilizing humans. Of course, we check them afterwards, but LLMs
                were themselves built for translation and semantic
                understanding, so they are incredibly good at delivering
                context-rich, consistent, and great translations better than
                humans are.
              </p>
              <p>
                What's great about this solution is that translations are
                instant and excellent, and you don't have to spend hundreds of
                hours finding what needs to be translated and passing them off
                to an external team, you don't have to wait days for bad quality
                translations, you don't have to maintain a bot to merge
                completed translations into the codebase, and you don't have to
                pass context yourself.
              </p>

                We've got a pilot running on our site right now, so if you've
                got a Next.js project, feel free to try it out using the script
                on our homepage:
                <a href="https://getquetzal.com">https://getquetzal.com</a>. If
                you've got a project written in some other framework, like
                vanilla React or React Native, reach out to us
                (founders@getquetzal.com), we've got npm packages that support
                these too. If you'd like to see support for something else
                entirely, like Swift, please let us know and we'll move it up on
                our docket.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me know what you all think about how software translation is
                today. Is it hard? What approaches have worked or not? We also
                want to explore problems like how people reach new markets and
                find customers, so that’s something we’re thinking a lot about
                as well. If you’ve got funny bad translation stories, I’d love
                to hear those too, the more shocking and hilarious the better.

              <p>
                We’re Brendan and Michael, the creators of Sourcebot (<a
                  href="https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
                  >https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot</a
                >). Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool that allows you
                to quickly search across many large codebases. Check out our
                demo video here:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4"
                  >https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4</a
                >, or try it for yourself on our demo site here:

              </p>
              <p>
                While at prior roles, we’ve both felt the pain of searching
                across hundreds of multi-million line codebases. Using local
                tools like grep were ill-suited since you often only had a
                handful of codebases checked out at a time. Sourcegraph (<a
                  href="https://sourcegraph.com/"
                  >https://sourcegraph.com/</a
                >) solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in
                the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is
                the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is
                often cited as expensive ($49 per user / month) and recently
                went closed source (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481</a
                >). That’s why we built Sourcebot.
              </p>
              <p>We designed Sourcebot to be:</p>
              <p>
                - Easily deployed: we provide a single, self-contained Docker
                image (<a
                  href="https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/sourcebot"
                  >https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/so...</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                - Fast &amp; scalable: designed to minimize search times
                (current average is ~73ms) across many large repositories.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Cross code-host support: we currently support syncing public
                &amp; private repositories in GitHub and GitLab.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Quality UI: we like to think that a good looking dev-tool is
                more pleasant to use.
              </p>
              <p>- Open source: Sourcebot is free to use by anyone.</p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, we use Zoekt (<a
                  href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt"
                  >https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt</a
                >) as our code search engine, which was originally authored by
                Han-Wen Nienhuys and now maintained by Sourcegraph (<a
                  href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-accepting-zoekt-maintainership"
                  >https://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-accepting-zoekt-mai...</a
                >). Zoekt works by building a trigram index from the source code
                enabling extremely fast regular expression matching. Russ Cox
                has a great article on how trigram indexes work if you’re
                interested:
                <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html"
                  >https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                In the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to
                make, like:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Improving how we communicate indexing progress (this is
                currently non-existent so it’s not obvious how long things will
                take)
              </p>
              <p>
                - UX improvements like search history, query syntax highlighting
                &amp; suggestions, etc.
              </p>
              <p>- Small QOL improvements like bookmarking code snippets.</p>
              <p>
                - Support for more code hosts (e.g., BitBucket, SourceForge,
                ADO, etc.)
              </p>
              <p>
                In the longer-term, we want to investigate how we could go
                beyond just traditional code search by leveraging machine
                learning to enable experiences like semantic code search (“where
                is system X located?”) and code explanations (”how does system X
                interact with system Y?”). You could think of this as a copilot
                being embedded into Sourcebot. Our hunch is that will be useful
                to devs, especially when packaged with the traditional code
                search, but let us know what you think.
              </p>

                We’re sharing some of the challenges we faced building an AI
                video interface that has realistic conversations with a human,
                including getting it to under 1 second of latency.
              </p>
              <p>
                To try it, talk to Hassaan’s digital twin:
                <a href="https://www.hassaanraza.com"
                  >https://www.hassaanraza.com</a
                >, or to our "demo twin" Carter:

              </p>
              <p>
                We built this because until now, we've had to adapt
                communication to the limits of technology. But what if we could
                interact naturally with a computer? Conversational video makes
                it possible – we think it'll eventually be a key human-computer
                interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make conversational video effective, it has to have really
                low latency and conversational awareness. A fast-paced
                conversation between friends has ~250 ms between utterances, but
                if you’re talking about something more complex or with someone
                new, there is additional “thinking” time. So, less than 1000 ms
                latency makes the conversation feel pretty realistic, and that
                became our target.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our architecture decisions had to balance 3 things: latency,
                scale, &amp; cost. Getting all of these was a huge challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first lesson learned was to make it low-latency, we had to
                build it from the ground up. We went from a team that cared
                about seconds to a team that counts every millisecond. We also
                had to support thousands of conversations happening all at once,
                without getting destroyed on compute costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, during early development, each conversation had to
                run on an individual H100 in order to fit all components and
                model weights into GPU memory just to run our Phoenix-1 model
                faster than 30fps. This was unscalable &amp; expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                We developed a new model, Phoenix-2, with a number of
                improvements, including inference speed. We switched from a NeRF
                based backbone to Gaussian Splatting for a multitude of reasons,
                one being the requirement that we could generate frames faster
                than realtime, at 70+ fps on lower-end hardware. We exceeded
                this and focused on optimizing memory and core usage on GPU to
                allow for lower-end hardware to run it all. We did other things
                to save on time and cost like using streaming vs batching,
                parallelizing processes, etc. But those are stories for another
                day.
              </p>
              <p>
                We still had to lower the utterance-to-utterance time to hit our
                goal of under a second of latency. This meant each component
                (vision, ASR, LLM, TTS, video generation) had to be
                hyper-optimized.
              </p>
              <p>
                The worst offender was the LLM. It didn’t matter how fast the
                tokens per second (t/s) were, it was the time-to-first token
                (tfft) that really made the difference. That meant services like
                Groq were actually too slow – they had high t/s, but slow ttft.
                Most providers were too slow.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next worst offender was actually detecting when someone
                stopped speaking. This is hard. Basic solutions use time after
                silence to ‘determine’ when someone has stopped talking. But it
                adds latency. If you tune it to be too short, the AI agent will
                talk over you. Too long, and it’ll take a while to respond. The
                model had to be dedicated to accurately detecting end-of-turn
                based on conversation signals, and speculating on inputs to get
                a head start.
              </p>
              <p>
                We went from 3-5 to &lt;1 second (&amp; as fast as 600 ms) with
                these architectural optimizations while running on lower-end
                hardware.
              </p>
              <p>
                All this allowed us to ship with a less than 1 second of
                latency, which we believe is the fastest out there. We have a
                bunch of customers, including Delphi, a professional coach and
                expert cloning platform. They have users that have conversations
                with digital twins that span from minutes, to one hour, to even
                four hours (!) - which is mind blowing, even to us.
