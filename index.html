              <a href="https://stack-auth.com/">https://stack-auth.com/</a>), an
              open-source managed authentication and authorization platform.
              Basically, we build your login and signup pages, and everything
              that comes with that.
              <p>
                You can find our customer pitch elsewhere, so instead I'll tell
                you more about us and the company. We are developers building
                for other developers, so you can think of everyone here as a
                devX engineer. We launched with a Show HN in April, and have
                been growing exponentially since.
              </p>
              <p>
                Think of us as a fast-moving open-source infrastructure
                business. We spend a lot of time thinking about how we can
                maintain the agility of a startup while being as reliable as
                incumbents. Sometimes, this means new ideas; for example, we
                heavily rely on AI and snapshots for our E2E tests, and have API
                migration tooling that blows everyone else out of the water. If
                you have ideas like these, we want you.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've sworn to keep a no-bullshit culture. We're all pulling on
                the same string; we don't keep secrets from each other and
                always assume good faith. We want to build the open-source cloud
                infrastructure of the future; we'd rather die trying than sell
                out for a quick buck.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are (very) well-funded by investors such as YC, Paul Graham,
                Guillermo Rauch, Theo Browne, and Khosla Ventures. Our number
                one priority is to build an outstanding product that developers
                *really* love — everything else comes second.
              </p>
              <p>
                For now, we are exclusively hiring onsite in San Francisco;
                sadly, we don't currently have any remote positions. Optionally,
                you can move with us into our hacker house (both temporarily or
                permanent), but you can live in your own home too.
              </p>
              <p>
                If that sounds like a great fit, email me mentioning that you're
                from HN and tell me why we caught your eye: konsti (at)
                stack-auth.com
              </p>
              <p>Thanks all!</p>

              <p>
                We were working on voice agents in healthcare, and kept running
                into the same problem: manually testing was incredibly
                time-consuming and error-prone. Testing voice AI in a
                comprehensive way was far more difficult than we had anticipated
                – not just the setup, but the ongoing monitoring of production
                calls. Despite our best efforts, some calls still failed once we
                went live.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main challenges we faced were: (1) Demonstrating reliability
                to customers for production was really tough; (2) Manual testing
                was incomplete and didn't cover edge cases; (3) We couldn’t
                easily simulate all possible conversations, especially with
                diverse customer personas; (4) Monitoring every production call
                manually was a huge time sink.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built Vocera to solve these problems. Vocera automatically
                simulates real personas, generates a wide range of testing
                scenarios from your prompts/call scripts and monitors all
                production calls. The result? You can be sure your voice agents
                are reliable, and you get real-time insights into how they’re
                performing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our platform tests how your AI responds to diverse personas,
                evaluates the conversation against different metrics and gives
                you directed feedback on the issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                What’s different about us is that we don’t just automate the
                evaluation. We generate scenarios and metrics automatically, so
                developers do not have to spend time defining their scenarios or
                eval metrics. This saves them a ton of time. Obviously, we give
                them the option to define these manually as well. Also, we
                provide detailed analytics on the agent's performance across
                simulations so developers do not need to listen to all call
                recordings manually.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re building voice agents and want to ensure they’re
                reliable and production-ready, or if you’re just interested in
                the challenges of Voice AI, we’d love to chat.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love to get your feedback, thoughts, or experiences related
                to testing voice agents!

                We’re currently working on features like saving and loading game
                states, allowing users to create their own NPCs, and enabling
                user-personas to evolve over time. We’re also exploring a quirky
                concept: a digital copy of yourself as an NPC. Image you seeding
                it with your backstory and goals and have it interact with other
                players' AIs in the game, learning from other digital clones,
                identifying interesting people or ideas, and flagging them for
                you to use in real life.
              </p>
