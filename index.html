                We decided to launch our "course" as an MCP server. This way
                your coding agent actually teaches the course content to you and
                can help you write the code. We think this is a really
                interactive way to learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using an editor with MCP support (such as Cursor, Windsurf, or
                VSCode), your code agent will call the appropriate MCP tools
                which will return context for the agent. This context tries to
                instruct the agent that it should be teaching you the content,
                not just doing the work for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The course is still pretty experimental and some models work
                better than others. Code is available in the Mastra Github repo
                in the mcp-docs-server package (<a

                We are bringing an upgraded version of the long beloved SO-101
                robot arms to a $219 price point with improved mechanical design
                and added intelligence.

                I’ve spent a few years building RC planes (<a
                  href="https://cyo.ng/hangar/"
                  >https://cyo.ng/hangar/</a
                >) and micro gas turbines (<a href="https://set.mit.edu"
                  >https://set.mit.edu</a
                >), and I’ve always wished hardware were cheaper so more people
                could experiment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m now launching a $219 desktop robot-arm kit that keeps
                LeRobot SO-101’s kinematics, swaps key parts for sturdier, more
                precise SLA prints, and adds two integrated 480 p cameras. After
                plenty of supplier haggling, the whole kit costs less than the
                twelve servos alone. I’ll release the updated mechanical design
                under an MIT license by June 30.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the software side, I'll also release an MIT-licensed MCP
                server by June 30 that exposes the local robot policy as tools
                for agentic LLMs (Opus 4, o3, etc.) to use in long-horizon
                tasks. Here's how it works: You can teach the robot new skills
                through teleoperation. During inference, you simply talk to the
                agentic LLM using natural language instructions. The LLM then
                calls the local robot policy through MCP, automatically

                I’d love your feedback! Beyond manufacturing, cleaning up the
                codebase, and writing docs, I’m considering: a force-controlled
                gripper, a parallel-jaw gripper, an extra wrist DOF (matching
                the new Trossen and ARX arms), full force feedback on the leader
                arm (though that may triple the price), a more affordable
                version with lower resolution each joint, and a longer-reach
                variant. Which of these—or something else—would be most useful
                to you?

            <div class="text">
              <a href="https://bitboard.work">https://bitboard.work</a>). We
              build AI agents that handle repetitive administrative tasks in
              healthcare clinics like filling out intake forms, prepping charts,
              or managing referrals.
              <p>
                We were early employees at Forward, which provided primary care
                across the US. To scale this, we relied on thousands of remote
                contractors to do repetitive administrative work like
                reconciling patient records, and scheduling follow-ups based on
                care plans. It was a huge bottleneck—expensive, error-prone, and
                always pulling attention away from clinical care. Our software
                solutions were always too brittle, never managing to handle the
                variance of clinical data we oversaw.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI, when applied well, is capable of performing a lot of the
                tasks we manually did. So we decided to take another crack at
                the problem by building today what we would have liked to have
                back then, and to help clinics use it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clinics send us their SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures—for
                example, “prep a patient chart from these records before a
                visit”), and we turn them into AI agents that do the work. These
                agents act like remote contractors: they log into EHRs, navigate
                internal tools, and do the work in the background. Unlike
                classical RPA, we build in verification and deterministic
                checks, so customers can confirm it was done right. Unlike
                low-code tools, there’s nothing new to learn. Customers don’t
                have to touch a UI or maintain logic. They just hand us the
                task, and we do it. Clinicians don’t want more screens! They
                erode attention and cause weird bottlenecks in operations
                because someone has to drive them. Our product is built to
                address this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a demo video:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g</a
                >. We’re not self-serve yet, but we deploy with customers in
                days after onboarding them. We’re working on speeding that up.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of our early customers is a fast-growing obesity medicine
                group. Their MAs were spending 15 to 20 minutes per patient just
                entering intake form data into the EHR. That one task was taking
                up 30% of their MA time. We took it over in a week. It’s now
                fully automated, and they’ve cleared the backlog and sped up
                visits.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few technical problems are specifically relevant to building
                healthcare agents:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Unreliable interfaces: many EHRs and clinic tools don’t follow
                modern web standards, making automation brittle. We’ve forked
                browser-use to solve some of these challenges. We’re working on
                analogous infrastructure to let agents operate on desktops and
                across a wide range of APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Verification: in healthcare, tasks need to be provably
                correct. We embed deterministic checks into each workflow so
                agents can confirm the task was completed as expected and the
                output is accurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Workflow generation: clinic SOPs are written in natural
                language and vary widely, yet still describe the actual process
                that works for clinics.
              </p>
              <p>
                We charge per task, based on complexity. We’re HIPAA compliant,
                audit-logged, and operate in a zero-retention environment unless
                auditing requires otherwise.
              </p>
              <p>
                A meaningful part is building trust in a high-stakes environment
                like healthcare. Part of that is making the product reliable.
                But another educational part is learning how to introduce a new
                concept like “agents” to clinics. We’re working on the right
                ways to describe them, to onboard them, to measure them.
                Endearingly, one of our customers’ agents is named “Robert Ott”,
                and they refer to him by name in their weekly updates like he’s
                a member of the team :) We’re learning a lot and have a long way
                to go.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love to meet other folks who 1. work in medical groups or
                health systems and want to offload repetitive work, and 2. are
                building in this space and want to trade notes. We’re happy to
                share everything we’ve learned so far.
              </p>
              <p>
                And this is a big space, with a lot of learnings from personal
                stories, from clinicians, technologists, administrators, and
                more. What do you make of it? We’d love to hear from you.

              <p>We're Onlook, the Cursor for Designers.</p>
              <p>
                We made an open-source (18k stars) visual editor for code that
                lets anyone craft changes to codebases using AI on an infinite
                canvas. We just had a blowout launch of our latest product on
                HN, 10xing our traffic and making us the #1 trending Github repo
                in the world for 3 days in a row.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re looking to bring on Onlook’s first Founding Engineer to
                work with us in our incredibly cool office in downtown San
                Fransisco. You’re a full-stack engineer with experience in AI
                who is ready to build a generational design-led company.
              </p>
              <p>The Role</p>
              <p>
                This role requires autonomy – you’ll lay the foundation for an
                uncompromising open-source visual IDE that tens-of-thousands of
                engineers and designers around the world love, and help craft
                our AI.
              </p>
              <p>The most important things we look for:</p>
              <p>
                • Olympic-level dedication – you want to be the best in the
                world at what you do. • Ownership – you like autonomy and
                control over the destiny of the company. • Speed – you’re
                comfortable shipping and iterating quickly with feedback. •
                Craft – you’re opinionated and are willing to defend your
                opinions.
              </p>
              <p>Ideally, you:</p>
              <p>
                • Are looking for a fast-paced, intense startup environment. •
                Are willing to put in long hours and go the extra mile. • Are
                comfortable with any part of the stack, front-end, back-end, or
                database. • Believe in open source and are ok with your work
                being very public.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’d like to stand out, please share a project or piece of
                work that you’re most proud of. We love seeing people’s work.
              </p>
              <p>Working at Onlook</p>
              <p>
                We’re based in San Francisco, the startup capital of the world,
                and work closely together in person. We have a very cool office
                near South Park – it has ultra tall ceilings, tons of natural
                light, great restaurants and groceries stores just a block away,
                a full-kitchen, and even a shower. Employees get bespoke black
                bomber jackets with the Onlook crest embroidered on them, their
                own standing desk, monitor, budget for tech, and more swag.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must be willing to move to San Francisco if you are not
                already here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Onlook’s values are a reflection of our founding team and the
                cultures of the companies we’ve come from. Speed, technical
                excellence, brand, and attention to detail are what uniquely set
                Onlook apart.

              <p>
                I stumbled upon the color quantization problem while doing
                something related for work. I then found an interesting paper
                for which I could find no implementations online, and the thing
                went from "let's implement this paper" to getting pretty
                obsessed with the whole thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's at an early, eaaaarly stage. There's a lot of work to be
                done, and it's a memory hog, but generally speaking works quite
                well, and the output is for the most part very high quality, so
                I'm happy to share it as beta.
