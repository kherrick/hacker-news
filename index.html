              <p>I'm Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous.</p>
              <p>
                Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software
                development for every company in the world. We're starting with
                a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort
                from developers.
              </p>
              <p>
                How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site,
                and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay
                these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots
                at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual
                regressions before they hit production. We employ novel
                techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo
                at [meticulous.ai](<a href="http://meticulous.ai/"
                  >http://meticulous.ai/</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team
                previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and
                have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these
                companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best
                founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including
                Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner
                (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen
                (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of
                Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an
                entire category of products to build on top of replay. This
                ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance
                impact of frontend code.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to change the way the world develops software, and
                influence software approaches for decades to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding
                engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here
                are a few problems you might work on:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of
                sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains
                determinism.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code
                paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative,
                software engineers.
              </p>
              <p>
                As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build
                the culture and technology from the ground up.
              </p>
              <p>What we look for:</p>
              <p>
                In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with,
                combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We
                also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each
                other; we win as a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level
                skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have
                strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software
                engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code,
                Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc.
                or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value
                transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong
                desire to become the best engineer you can be.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can read about our values here
                <a
                  href="https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d"

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an
                engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think
                will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship,
                if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running
                100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech
                companies).
              </p>
              <p>
                You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there
                are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and
                deliver something that transforms how software is built.
              </p>

              <p>
                We now have, somewhat unexpectedly this early, the interest of a
                large enterprise that wants a deal to onboard 5000+ users. The
                problem is that we have no idea how to price this, as we have
                not yet had time to scale up our pricing enough to gain the
                necessary experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our current pricing model, for smaller customers, is a simple,
                linear $49 per-seat plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                - How do pricing for enterprise SaaS usually work? - What kind
                of volume discounts are they expecting? - Should we offer a
                "flat" price for 1-3 year contract, or per-seat model? - How did
                you handle your first large-scale customers?
              </p>
              <p>
                We honestly feel a bit thrown into the deep end here, and we
                don't want to miss this opportunity just because we are
                inexperienced.
