              <p>Long story below.</p>
              <p>--------------------------</p>
              <p>
                We originally set out to work on technical debt. We had all seen
                codebases with a lot of debt, so we had personal grudges about
                the problem, and AI seemed to be making it a lot worse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tech debt also seemed like a great problem for AI because: 1) a
                small portion of the work is thinky and strategic, and then the
                bulk of the execution is pretty mechanical, and 2) when you're
                solving technical debt, you're usually trying to preserve
                existing behavior, just change the implementation. That means
                you can treat it as a closed-loop problem if you figure out good
                ways to detect unintended behavior changes due to a code change.
                And we know how to do that – that's what tests are for!
              </p>
              <p>
                So we started with writing tests. Tests create the guardrails
                that make future code changes safer. Our thinking was: if we can
                test well enough, we can automate a lot of other tech debt work
                at very high quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built an agent that could write thousands of new tests for a
                typical codebase, most "merge-quality". Some early users merged
                hundreds of PRs generated this way, but intuitively the tool
                always felt "good but not great". We used it sporadically
                ourselves, and it usually felt like a chore.
              </p>
              <p>
                Around this point we realized: while we had set out to write
                good tests, we had built a system that, with a few tweaks, might
                be very good at finding bugs. When we tested it out on some
                friends' codebases, we discovered that almost every repo has
                tons of bugs lurking in it that we were able to flag. Serious
                bugs, interesting enough that people dropped what they were
                doing to fix them. Sitting right there in peoples codebases,
                already merged, running in prod.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also found a lot of vulns, even in mature codebases, and
                sometimes even right after someone had gotten a pentest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood: - We check out a codebase and figure out how to
                build it for local dev and exercise it with tests. - We take
                snapshots of the built local dev state. (We use Runloop for this
                and are big fans.) - We spin up hundreds of copies of the local
                dev environment to exercise the codebase in thousands of ways
                and flag behaviors that seem wrong. - We pick the most salient,
                scary examples and deliver them as linear tickets, github
                issues, or emails.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, it's working pretty well. We've been able to find
                bugs in everything from compilers to trading platforms (even in
                rust code), but the sweet spot is app backends.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our approach trades compute for quality. Our codebase scans take
                hours, far beyond what would be practical for a code review bot.
                But the result is that we can make more judicious use of
                engineers’ attention, and we think that’s going to be the most
                important variable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Longer term, we think compute is cheap, engineer attention is
                expensive. Wielded properly, the newest models can execute
                complicated changes, even in large codebases. That means the
                limiting reagent in building software is human attention. It
                still takes time and focus for an engineer to ingest
                information, e.g. existing code, organizational context, and
                product requirements. These are all necessary before an engineer
                can articulate what they want in precise terms and do a
                competent job reviewing the resulting diff.
              </p>
              <p>
                For now we're finding bugs, but the techniques we're developing
                extend to a lot of other background, semi-proactive work to
                improve codebases.

                We're also scanning on OSS repos, if you have any requests. The
                system is pretty high signal-to-noise, but we don't want to risk
                annoying maintainers by automatically opening issues, so if you
                request a scan for an OSS repo the results will go to you
                personally.

              behavior, steering reasoning and removing bias on the fly, without
              the compute of fine-tuning or the brittleness of prompt

                This resonates in highly regulated industries or otherwise risky
                applications of AI where the fallout from incorrect or
                underperforming output can be significant. In financial
                services, using GenAI to scan for noncompliant communications
                can be arduous without an easy way to embed complex policies
                into the model. Similarly, a media outlet might want to scale
                AI-generated summaries of their content, but reliability and
                accuracy is paramount. These are both applications where Fortune
                500 companies have utilized our technology to improve subpar
                performance from existing models, and we want to bring this
                capability to more people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a quick 2-minute demo video showing the process:

              <p>
                Standard "guardrails" like RAG and system prompts are
                fundamentally probabilistic: you are essentially asking the
                model nicely to behave. This often fails in two ways. First, RAG
                solves knowledge <i>availability</i> but not <i>integration</i>.
                In our benchmarks, a model given context that "Lerwick is 228
                miles SE of Tórshavn" failed to answer "What is 228 miles NW of
                Lerwick?" because it couldn't perform the spatial inversion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, prompt engineering is brittle because it fights against
                the model's pre-training priors. For example, on the TruthfulQA
                benchmark, base models fail ~80% of the time because they mimic
                common misconceptions found on the internet (e.g. "chameleons
                change color for camouflage"). We found that we could literally
                turn up the feature for "skeptical reasoning" to make the model
                ignore the popular myth and output the scientific fact. This
                matters because for high-stakes use cases (like Finance or
                Pharma), "mostly safe" isn't acceptable—companies need
                audit-grade reliability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our work stems from the CS dungeon at UCSD, with years spent
                researching efficient and interpretable AI, trying to "open the
                black box" of neural networks. We realized that the industry was
                trying to patch model behavior from the outside
                (prompts/filters) when the problem was on the inside (feature
                activations). We knew this was important when we saw enterprises
                struggling to deploy basic models despite having unlimited
                compute, simply because they couldn't guarantee the output
                wouldn't violate compliance rules. I ended up leaving my
                research at Stanford to focus on this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our breakthrough came while researching the DeepSeek-R1 model.
                We identified the "censorship" feature vector in its latent
                space. Amplifying it guaranteed refusal; subtracting it
                instantly unlocked answers to sensitive questions. This proved
                the model <i>had</i> the knowledge but was suppressing it. We
                realized we could apply this same logic to hallucinations,
                suppressing "confabulation" features to reveal the grounded
                truth. While some hallucinations stem from the inherent
                randomness of generative models, many can be identified with the
                concerted activation of a feature or group of features.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of filtering outputs, we intervene at the activation
                level during the forward pass. We identify latent feature
                vectors (v) associated with specific behaviors (bias,
                misconception) and mathematically modify the hidden state (h):
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  h_prime = h - alpha * (h @ v) * v
</code></pre>
              This arithmetic operation lets us "edit" behavior
              deterministically with negligible overhead (&lt;10ms on R1). For
              factual claims, we combine this with a graph verification pipeline
              (which works on closed weight models). We check semantic entropy
              (is the model babbling?) and cross-reference claims against a
              dynamic knowledge graph to catch subtle relational hallucinations
              that vector search misses.
              <p>
                On GPT-OSS-120b, this approach improved TruthfulQA accuracy from
                21% to 70% by suppressing misconception features. We also
                improved the performance of this model to frontier levels on
                HaluEval-QA, where we reached 96.5% accuracy, solving the
                spatial reasoning failures where the baseline failed. It also
                handles noisy inputs, inferring "David Icke" from the typo
                "David Of me" where base models gave up. Full benchmarks at

                Most startups in this space are observability tools that tell
                you only after the model failed. Or they are RAG pipelines that
                stuff context into the window. Mentat is an infrastructure layer
                that modifies the model's processing during inference. We fix
                the reasoning, not just the context. For example, that’s how our
                system was able to enforce that if A is SE of B, then B is NW of
                A.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that our policy engine is a superior control
                mechanism to RAG or prompting. If you’re frustrated with current
                guardrails, we’d love it if you would stress-test our API!

                AlgoDrill turns NeetCode 150 and more into pattern-based drills:
                you rebuild the solution line by line with active recall, get
                first principles editorials that explain why each step exists,
                and everything is tagged by patterns like sliding window, two
                pointers, and DP so you can hammer the ones you keep forgetting.
                The goal is simple: turn familiar patterns into code you can
                write quickly and confidently in a real interview.

              <p>
                Would love feedback on whether this drill-style approach feels
                like a real upgrade over just solving problems once, and what’s
                most confusing or missing when you first land on the site.
