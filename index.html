              <p>
                XPipe is a new type of connection hub that allows you to access
                your entire server infrastructure from your local desktop. It
                can make your life easier when working with any kind of servers
                by eliminating all the commonly tedious tasks that come up when
                interacting with remote systems, either from the terminal or
                from a graphical interface. XPipe comes with integrations for
                SSH, docker and other containers, various hypervisors like
                Proxmox, Kubernetes clusters, tools like Teleport and Tailscale,
                and more without requiring any setup on your remote systems. You
                can link your favourite text/code editors, terminals, password
                managers, shells, command-line tools, and more with it, allowing
                you to keep using your own favourite tools when working with
                XPipe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire implementation of how it communicates with remote
                systems is completely different from most other solutions out
                there. What happens in the background can essentially be
                explained this way: It launches a local shell process like cmd
                or bash and executes a command that opens a remote shell
                connection such as ssh user@host in that shell process. All
                communication is then done through the stdin/stdout/stderr of
                that shell process. From there, it detects what kind of server
                and environment, such as shell type, os, user, etc. you have
                logged into and adjusts how it talks to the remote system. By
                then using, for example, file system related commands such as
                ls, rm, touch, etc. and its equivalents, it can realize a
                functional file manager that can connect to essentially every
                system.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is essentially the same idea as emacs TRAMP mode if you have
                ever used that. With the difference being that it works on all
                kinds of systems and is also not constrained to a certain
                editor/tool environment. VSCode also uses a similar approach for
                some of the remote development tools with SSH, but that one is
                more limited in scope and is a little bit sluggish to use. And
                it's also bound to the VSCode platform. The goal of XPipe's
                implementation is to not be limited by a certain environment or
                specific set of tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                The development took a while as this new approach requires a
                completely new implementation in many areas, but I am confident
                that it's ready now. I appreciate any kind of feedback from you
                to guide me in the right development direction from here.
              </p>
              <p>Enjoy!</p>

              observability data in real time, automatically identifies
              anomalies, and lets you interact with your logs through natural
              language queries. Here’s a demo video:

              <p>
                We used to work on product and engineering at Datadog and
                Splunk. We saw how even teams using these industry-leading tools
                were struggling to effectively interpret and use their logging
                data. The sheer volume of logs overwhelmed experts and newcomers
                alike, making it difficult to quickly identify meaningful issues
                or patterns. Despite powerful indexing and search capabilities,
                developers still had to manually piece together context from
                different logs, dashboards, and sources—a tedious and
                error-prone process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The “noisy logging” problem—that is, the gap between
                overwhelming amounts of raw log data and insights people can act
                on—ultimately is a gap between machines (which generate all this
                data) and humans (who want and need the insights). SiftDev is
                built to bridge that gap and to automate the tedious, manual
                aspects of debugging and observability. In marketing-speak:
                “humans should never have to look at a log again!” We think
                people should interact with their data in terms that make sense
                on a human level.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes SiftDev different is its understanding of application
                context over time. While traditional tooling typically lets
                developers analyze logs in isolation, or with minimal
                surrounding context, SiftDev builds comprehensive profiles of
                your application's normal behavior patterns. This awareness
                allows us to understand what's truly abnormal versus what might
                appear unusual in a single snapshot but is actually expected
                behavior for your specific application. SiftDev applies semantic
                analysis and profiling to understand your application's logging
                behavior holistically. Instead of relying solely on manual
                search, Sift identifies core application processes,
                automatically detects patterns, and surfaces anomalies,
                including clear explanations and context.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some examples of what this can look like in practice:
                Identify core processes: SiftDev instantly recognizes your
                payment workflows—like authorization, capture, and
                refunds—without manual tagging. Detect performance patterns:
                SiftDev learns your nightly batch job typically handles 10,000
                records in 45 minutes, establishing a clear baseline. Surface
                hidden anomalies: SiftDev flags silent failures, such as two
                microservices updating the same record within 50ms—issues
                normally hidden by routine logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can then directly ask your logs questions like, “What's
                causing errors in our checkout service?” or “Why did latency
                spike at 2 AM?” and immediately receive insightful, actionable
                answers that you’d otherwise manually be searching for.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love for you to test out our product via our demo
                playground at

                It’s a slightly less functional version of our platform but
                shares a lot of the core features. Note: we do need users to
                sign up to do this but waitlist is optional (of course).

                Pila (<a href="https://pila.energy/">https://pila.energy/</a>)
                is a home battery that plugs into a standard wall outlet,
                provides smart backup power, energy shifting, and grid services.
                It’s more than a power bank—it’s a distributed energy system
                that can scale across multiple rooms, entire buildings, and work
                together in real time as a coordinated system. We built Pila to
                be local first with an open API to allow developers to build use
                cases on top of our hardware (Home Assistant, etc).
              </p>
              <p>
                Big batteries like Tesla Powerwall and Enphase are great if you
                own a home and can afford a $10K+ electrical project, but they
                require permanent installation, electricians, and panel
                upgrades—which makes them inaccessible for renters, apartments,
                and cost-conscious homeowners. Over 50% of the cost of
                installing a Powerwall isn’t even the battery itself—it’s soft
                costs: labor, permitting, etc. We wanted to create an entry
                point for more people to access energy security at home.
              </p>
              <p>How does it work?</p>
              <p>
                Plug Pila into any 120V wall outlet, and power passes through to
                connected devices and appliances. The inverter, LFP battery,
                BMS, grid disconnection, controller, and wireless connectivity
                are all built in. (details at
                <a href="https://pila.energy/tech-specs"
                  >https://pila.energy/tech-specs</a
                >)
              </p>
              <p>
                When an outage happens, the onboard inverter detects the power
                loss within 20ms and automatically disconnects from the grid
                (islanding). Whether you’re home or away, backup kicks in
                instantly. A built-in cellular radio ensures you get a
                notification even if your home WiFi is out. Pila is 1.6kWh. That
                will backup a standard fridge for over a day.
              </p>
              <p>
                One key challenge we faced with a distributed architecture was
                coordination between batteries, for things like solar-following
                and managing real-time draw from your utility connection. Unlike
                large garage systems, where you can run a wired CAN bus, our
                batteries are spread across the home. We’re solving this with a
                sub-GHz wireless mesh network—self-healing, coordinator-less,
                and designed to make setup and expansion as simple as plugging
                in another unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Long-term, we’d love to open up this protocol to provide a more
                reliable communication layer for energy products in noisy built
                environments—reducing reliance on consumer Wi-Fi.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to deliver the value you’d expect from a whole-home
                battery like Powerwall, in a plug-in format. That means going
                beyond a basic lead acid UPS with real home energy management,
                useful insights about power use, power larger loads like sump
                pumps, and even deliver grid services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most portable batteries are missing the functionality that makes
                a home battery useful: no bidirectional power, no integration
                with solar or smart home systems, and no ability to manage home
                energy dynamically. They tend to be boxy, ruggedized, meant to
                be moved around, not seamlessly integrated into your living
                space. On top of that, many use e-mobility battery chemistries,
                which are great for delivering high power on demand but wear out
                faster when cycled daily for home energy use.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a renter myself, I started Pila because these awesome energy
                products aren’t accessible enough. And frankly, generators are
                loud, expensive, and a pain to deal with. Even many Powerwall
                owners I’ve talked to say they really care about keeping the
                fridge, WiFi, and a sump pump running—so why does energy
                resilience have to be so complicated and expensive?
              </p>
              <p>
                As the grid struggles to keep up with demand, we believe
                modular, renter-friendly batteries can make home energy
                resilience more accessible.
              </p>
              <p>
                What's been your experience with home batteries? What recent
                power outages have you had, and how were you affected?

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                FLE is an open-source framework for developing and evaluating
                LLM agents in Factorio. It provides a controlled environment
                where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource
                management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with
                meaningful constraints.
              </p>
              <p>
                A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded
                nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer
                models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't
                be "solved" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This
                allows us to meaningfully compare models by the
                order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a
                benchmark with longevity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio,
                recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few
                months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to
                create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial
                reasoning and long-term planning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we
                discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP
                enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding
                the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that
                wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted
                interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through
                familiar programming paradigms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern: 1. They observe
                the world (seeing the output of their last action) 2. Generate
                Python code to perform their next action 3. Receive detailed
                feedback (including exceptions and stdout)
              </p>
              <p>
                We provide two main evaluation settings: - Lab-play: 24
                structured tasks with fixed resources - Open-play: An unbounded
                task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally
                generated map
              </p>
              <p>
                We found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills,
                they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained
                environments. They can discover basic automation strategies
                (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more
                complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing).
                Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant
                margin).
              </p>
              <p>
                The code is available at
                <a

                  >https://github.com/JackHopkins/factorio-learning-environment</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                You'll need: - Factorio (version 1.1.110) - Docker - Python
                3.10+
              </p>
              <p>
                The README contains detailed installation instructions and
                examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do
                with this framework!
