                It's an unikernel design that is compiled as a single EFI binary
                and does not use virtual address spaces for process isolation.
                Instead, applications are compiled to WASM and run inside of an
                embedded WASM engine.
              </p>

              <p>
                There's currently a major effort to get this change reversed.
                One of the people working on it is YC's Luther Lowe (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=itsluther"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=itsluther</a
                >). Luther has been organizing YC alumni to urge lawmakers to
                support this reversal. I asked him if we could do that on Hacker
                News too. He said yes—hence this thread :)
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're a US taxpayer and if you agree that software dev
                expenses should be deductible like they used to be, please sign
                this letter to the relevant committee members:
                <a
                  href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DkRGeef2e_tU2xf3TyEyd2JLlmZH8sGs6hhuVkokgpw/viewform?edit_requested=true"
                  >https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DkRGeef2e_tU2xf3TyEyd2JLlmZ...</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                (If you're not a US person, please don't sign the letter, since
                lawmakers will only listen to feedback from taxpayers and we
                don't want to dilute the signal.)
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm sure not everyone here agrees with us—HN is a big community,
                there's no total agreement on anything—but this issue has as
                close to a community consensus as HN gets, so I think it makes
                sense to add our voices too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Luther will be around to answer questions and hopefully HN can
                contribute to getting this done!

              <p>
                Bhavnick and I have been building personal projects with LLMs
                for a few years. For much of this time, we found ourselves
                writing our own chunking logic to support RAG applications. We
                often hesitated to use existing libraries because they either
                had only basic features or felt too bloated (some are 80MB+).
              </p>
              <p>
                We built Chonkie to be lightweight, fast, extensible, and easy.
                The space is evolving rapidly, and we wanted Chonkie to be able
                to quickly support the newest strategies. We currently support:
                Token Chunking, Sentence Chunking, Recursive Chunking, Semantic
                Chunking, plus:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Semantic Double Pass Chunking: Chunks text semantically first,
                then merges closely related chunks.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Code Chunking: Chunks code files by creating an AST and
                finding ideal split points.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Late Chunking: Based on the paper (<a
                  href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04701"
                  >https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04701</a
                >), where chunk embeddings are derived from embedding a longer
                document.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Slumber Chunking: Based on the "Lumber Chunking" paper (<a
                  href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17526"
                  >https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17526</a
                >). It uses recursive chunking, then an LLM verifies split
                points, aiming for high-quality chunks with reduced token usage
                and LLM costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see how Chonkie compares to LangChain and LlamaIndex in
                our benchmarks:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md"
                  >https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie/blob/main/BENCHMARKS....</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Some technical details about the Chonkie package: - ~15MB
                default install vs. ~80-170MB for some alternatives. - Up to 33x
                faster token chunking compared to LangChain and LlamaIndex in
                our tests. - Works with major tokenizers (transformers,
                tokenizers, tiktoken). - Zero external dependencies for basic
                functionality. - Implements aggressive caching and
                precomputation. - Uses running mean pooling for efficient
                semantic chunking. - Modular dependency system (install only
                what you need).
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to chunking, Chonkie also provides an easy way to
                create embeddings. For supported providers (SentenceTransformer,
                Model2Vec, OpenAI), you just specify the model name as a string.
                You can also create custom embedding handlers for other
                providers.
              </p>
              <p>
                RAG is still the most common use case currently. However,
                Chonkie makes chunks that are optimized for creating high
                quality embeddings and vector retrieval, so it is not really
                tied to the "generation" part of RAG. In fact, We're seeing more
                and more people use Chonkie for implementing semantic search
                and/or setting context for agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are currently focused on building integrations to simplify
                the retrieval process. We've created "handshakes" – thin
                functions that interact with vector DBs like pgVector, Chroma,
                TurboPuffer, and Qdrant, allowing you to interact with storage
                easily. If there's an integration you'd like to see (vector DB
                or otherwise), please let us know.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also offer hosted and on-premise versions with OCR, extra
                metadata, all embedding providers, and managed vector databases
                for teams that want a fully managed pipeline. If you're
                interested, reach out at shreyash@chonkie.ai or book a demo:

              <p>
                In the past few years I've become more interested in machine
                learning. Since I'm sure the same is true for many here, I
                wanted to share this project I've been working on: glowstick
                uses type-directed metaprogramming to keep track of tensor
                shapes in Rust's type system and determine which operations are
                permitted or not at compile time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I find Rust has a lot of strengths when it comes to ML
                applications, but waiting until runtime to find shape related
                issues feels a bit strange since normally I don't run the code
                all that often while developing. Given Rust has fancy types
                available, I figured I'd try my hand at using them to address
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've added integration crates for the two ML frameworks I use
                most frequently, candle and burn, and included examples of
                implementing llama 3.2 in each using typed shapes for much of
                the model internals and inference loop. Mixtures of static and
                dynamic dimensions should be supported well enough for most
                applications at this point, though there are of course still
                improvements to be made.
              </p>
              <p>Any feedback is appreciated!</p>
