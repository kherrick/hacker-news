                Tom Howard is going public as HN moderator today. He has been
                doing HN moderation work for years already and knows the site
                and its practices inside-out, so the only new thing you'll see
                is mod comments from Tom showing up in the threads the way mine
                do. I'm not going anywhere, so you'll have two of us to put up
                with going forward :)
              </p>
              <p>
                I've known Tom since he was sctb's and my batchmate back in YC
                W09. Many of you know him as the kind and thoughtful community
                member tomhoward (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomhoward"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomhoward</a
                >). He's still kind and thoughtful, but he's going to post as
                tomhow from now on (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomhow"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomhow</a
                >), the same way I switched to dang when I went through this
                rite of passage years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Below is a bit from Tom about himself. Please join me in
                welcoming him to this new status which he was crazy enough to
                say yes to!

                  >YC and HN have been a huge part of my life for nearly two
                  decades. I read pg's essay How to Start a Startup in 2005
                  after my friend (and later, co-founder) Fenn found it on
                  Slashdot, and it opened our eyes as to how to go about
                  building products and companies. I first signed up in late
                  2007, and since then HN has been the place I come to find
                  interesting news and discussions.</i

              <p>
                <i
                  >Hacker News gave me a window into the big wide world of
                  technology and startups, that had previously seemed so remote
                  and opaque from where I lived (and still live) in Australia.
                  We were lucky enough to be accepted into the W09 batch of YC,
                  and since then HN has been a place where we could share
                  announcements about the startup, but also where I could share
                  the challenges and struggles I experienced in the startup
                  journey and other aspects of life, particularly to do with
                  health and wellbeing.</i

                <i
                  >From the discussions that have happened about these topics
                  I've ended up making enduring friendships with people all over
                  the world, and have been able to learn many things that have
                  improved my life in profound ways. I love HN's ethos - of
                  being a place people come to engage their curiosity. That's
                  what it's always been for me and what I hope I can help it to
                  be for everyone!</i
