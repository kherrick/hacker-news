                We’re Adrian, Katon, and Jeremy from PointOne (<a
                  href="https://pointone.ai"
                  >https://pointone.ai</a
                >). We’re building an app that automatically figures out what
                lawyers are doing and generates timesheets for them. Here’s a
                quick demo:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/yrL3e1hgaNc"
                  >https://youtu.be/yrL3e1hgaNc</a
                >, and here’s an even quicker one:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/giIaAxZp2M0"
                  >https://youtu.be/giIaAxZp2M0</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’ve ever hired a lawyer, you know most of them bill by the
                hour—or more specifically, by the 0.1 of an hour (hence our
                name!). What most clients don’t realize is how painful it is for
                lawyers to track all their work in 6-minute increments. Lawyers
                hate time tracking, and many say it’s the worst part of their
                jobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adrian started out his career as a corporate lawyer at Fenwick
                &amp; West. The first thing he was taught was how to track and
                bill his time. Between the 70-hour work weeks and billing to
                10-15+ clients per day, staying on top of timesheets is
                surprisingly hard. To make things worse, law firms are extremely
                particular about how narratives (that is, descriptions of tasks
                performed) are crafted—down to the punctuation and diction
                required. So, Adrian became chronically delinquent in submitting
                his timesheets, and the firm threatened to take away his bonus
                multiple times as a result.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attorney time tracking is not a new problem, and companies have
                been promising to solve it for years. But pre-LLM attempts at
                automatic timekeeping never worked as advertised. We were
                inspired by products like Rewind, and felt that a narrower
                vertical application could finally solve this problem for
                lawyers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our product is a desktop application that a lawyer turns on at
                the start of their work day. It runs passively in the background
                and captures logs from everywhere they work: the OS itself,
                Word, Excel, calendar, emails, web browser, Slack/Teams, etc. We
                then clean, pre-process, and interpret the logs. Modern LLMs
                enable a bunch of cool features. For example, we can pull subtle
                context from an attorney’s browser activity to associate that
                work with a client. And for each client and project, we use
                these models to generate a time entry with a narrative
                description that matches both the firm’s and the client’s style
                preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides the fact that lawyers hate timekeeping, using PointOne
                lets them be sure that they’re not letting time slip through the
                cracks, and frees up hours per week they can spend on other
                things. It also helps firm leadership by getting more consistent
                narratives, and faster timesheet submission.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given the sensitivity of the data captured, privacy and security
                are massively important. As such, we have customizable data
                retention periods, we do not use firm data to update models, and
                we encrypt all data (in addition to employing other standard
                practices for processing confidential data).
              </p>
              <p>
                Since our app primarily works for legal workflows, it might not
                be super useful for <i>most</i> people here (maybe some
                though!). We would love it if you could check out our demo
                video, leave your thoughts in the comments, and introduce us to
                any lawyers you know.

                Over the last several years, we’ve noticed that it’s getting
                increasingly difficult to stay in flow. We believe it’s because
                chat (i.e. Slack, Teams, and similar tools) has evolved into
                something it wasn’t designed for. Chat originally served as a
                way to free us from our desk by giving us the safety that if we
                were needed for immediate matters, people could reach us. Now
                it’s become a dumping ground for all communication: daily
                updates, product and engineering discussions, announcements,
                etc. Both of us still reminisce about the days of in-office
                work, before Slack became mainstream, where everyone abided by
                the headphone rule—the unwritten pact that headphones meant
                someone was in deep work and not to bother them unless you
                really needed to. Compared to then, the onus has now shifted to
                be on us to determine which chats are urgent and should take us
                out of flow vs. which messages can be responded to later. It
                feels like the very tool that was meant to liberate us instead
                made us beholden to its pings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Patchwork is our attempt to solve this problem by shifting the
                primary communication model from group chats to feeds. Posts are
                made in relevant groups and each team member has a home feed
                personalized to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The feed algorithm evaluates each post's relevance and urgency
                based on a bunch of factors, including the post’s content,
                user's role, ongoing projects, and recent interactions. Our goal
                is to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio with our feed’s
                algorithm so we can surface the most important information
                first. When you’re not in flow or in between meetings, you can
                check the feed to stay in sync.
              </p>
              <p>
                There have been feed-based work communication products before,
                but they’ve often overlooked the fact that writing a post has
                more friction than writing a chat message, which is why people
                often revert back to doing everything over chat. We’re combating
                this by using LLMs to create a better writing experience (ie.
                generate title and tl;dr, simplify selected content, change the
                tone, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                As a product team ourselves, we know that much of our work
                happens on different platforms. We’re building integrations with
                the likes of Github, Linear, Figma, GSuite etc. Having all of
                this activity from different platforms also rolling into our
                feeds allows us to stay in sync with all the different work
                being done on our team instead of having to check various
                sources of data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, we do have chat on the platform, but chat looks and
                feels like chat. It’s meant to be used for immediate needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s a demo of the product:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA3rmSjNjDw"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA3rmSjNjDw</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Since it’s a team communication product, it's hard to use it in
                single player mode, so we don’t have a “try it now” link to jump
                straight in. But you’re welcome to email us at
                hackernews@atpatchwork.com and we’ll onboard your team.
              </p>
              <p>
                The product is still early with a basic feed, a few
                integrations, and simple LLM assisted post creation, but the
                main flow is already there, so if the message resonates with
                you, we’d love for you to give it a try.
              </p>
              <p>
                More importantly, we’d love to hear your ideas about team
                communication and getting it back to working <i>for</i> people,
                not <i>at</i> them!

              <a href="https://withaqua.com/">https://withaqua.com/</a>). Aqua
              is a voice-native document editor that combines reliable dictation
              and natural language commands, letting you say things like: “make
              this a list” or “it’s Erin with an E” or “add an inline citation
              here for page 86 of this book”. Here is a demo:
              <a href="https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM"
                >https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM</a
              >.
              <p>
                Finn, who is big-time dyslexic, has been using dictation
                software since the sixth grade when his dad set him up on Dragon
                Dictation. He used it through school to write papers, and has
                been keeping his own transcription benchmarks since college. All
                that time, writing with your voice has remained a cumbersome and
                brittle experience that is riddled with painpoints.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dictation software is still terrible. All the solutions
                basically compete on accuracy (i.e. speech recognition), but
                none of them deal with the fundamentally brittle nature of the
                text that they generate. They don't try to format text correctly
                and require you to learn a bunch of specialized commands, which
                often are not worth it. They're not even close to a voice
                replacement for a keyboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even post LLM, you are limited to a set of specific commands and
                the most accurate models don’t have any commands. Outside of
                these rules, the models have no sense for what is an instruction
                and what is content. You can’t say “and format this like an
                email” or “make the last bullet point shorter”. Aqua solves
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                This problem is important to Finn and millions of other people
                who would write with their voice if they could. Initially, we
                didn't think of it as a startup project. It was just something
                we wanted for ourselves. We thought maybe we'd write a novel
                with it - or something. After friends started asking to use the
                early versions of Aqua, it occurred to us that, if we didn't
                build it, maybe nobody would.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aqua Voice is a text editor that you talk to like a person.
                Depending on the way that you say it and the context in which
                you're operating, Aqua decides whether to transcribe what you
                said verbatim, execute a command, or subtly modify what you said
                into what you meant to write.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if you were to dictate: "Gryphons have classic
                forms resembling shield volcanoes," Aqua would output your text
                verbatim. But if you stumble over your words or start a sentence
                over a few times, Aqua is smart enough to figure that out and to
                only take the last version of the sentence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vision is not only to provide a more natural dictation
                experience, but to enable for the first time an AI-writing
                experience that feels natural and collaborative. This requires
                moving away from using LLMs for one-off chat requests and
                towards something that is more like streaming where you are in
                constant contact with the model. Voice is the natural medium for
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aqua is actually 6 models working together to transcribe,
                interpret, and rewrite the document according to your intent.
                Technically, executing a real-time voice application with a
                language model at its core requires complex coordination between
                multiple pieces. We use MoE transcription to outperform what was
                previously thought possible in terms of real-time accuracy. Then
                we sync up with a language model to determine what should be on
                the screen as quickly as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The model isn't perfect, but it is ready for early adopters and
                we’ve already been getting feedback from grateful users. For
                example, a historian with carpal tunnel sent us an email he
                wrote using Aqua and said that he is now able to be five times
                as productive as he was previously. We've heard from other
                people with disabilities that prevent them from typing. We've
                also seen good adoption from people who are dyslexic or simply
                prefer talking to typing. It’s being used for everything from
                emails to brainstorming to papers to legal briefings.
              </p>
              <p>
                While there is much left to do in terms of latency and
                robustness, the best experiences with Aqua are beginning to feel
                magical. We would love for you to try it out and give us
                feedback, which you can do with no account on
                <a href="https://withaqua.com">https://withaqua.com</a>. If you
                find it useful, it’s $10/month after a 1000-token free trial.
                (We want to bump the free trial in the future, but we're a small
                team, and running this thing isn’t cheap.)
              </p>
              <p>
                We’d love to hear your ideas and comments with voice-to-text!
