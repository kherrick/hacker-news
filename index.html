              makes it clear which open source dependencies you should upgrade
              next, and how to do so safely. We do this by using a LLM to read
              every changelog.
              <p>

                We’re launching today with support for Ruby packages. If you’ve
                ever run `bundle outdated` or upgraded a Rails app, Infield is
                for you. You can try it on your own project at
                <a href="https://app.infield.ai/hn">https://app.infield.ai/hn</a
                >. Upload your Gemfile and Gemfile.lock (no email/name/cc
                required) and we’ll show you Infield on your code.

                I (Steve) have been building open source software and commercial
                web apps for more than a decade. I spent the last year
                personally upgrading Rails apps by hand for companies in order
                to research this problem. I'm convinced that every company is
                re-inventing the wheel and doing by hand a bunch of toilsome
                work that can be done with software.
              </p>
              <p>
                As one example, I was working as a consultant upgrading an app
                to Rails 7. This company was using the attr_encrypted gem to
                encrypt information at the database level. Rails 7 brings
                built-in support for encryption in a way that's incompatible
                with this gem. Having hit this same problem at two other
                companies I already knew how to handle the migration; but if I
                hadn’t, they could have risked their most sensitive customer
                data (this is what you tend to encrypt). After that project I
                started building a personal database of "upgrade experiences"
                and before long felt sure we could make useful software.
              </p>
              <p>
                The time-consuming part of package upgrades is not coding—it’s
                mostly risk assessment, research, and project planning. If I’m
                on a maintenance rotation and have half a day to pay down some
                technical debt, which package upgrades should I look at? I might
                end up spending that time trying to upgrade something only to
                get blocked and give up. Worse, many breaking changes are subtle
                and won’t be caught by CI. I’ve brought down production only to
                find an issue was buried in a changelog I didn’t read!
              </p>
              <p>
                Infield scans all of your dependencies to prioritize upgrades
                based on effort (how much work is this? Is it risky?) and impact
                (will upgrading fix a security issue? will it get me onto a
                supported branch?). We can do this because we use GPT to read
                the changelog for every package you rely on. Changelogs are
                broken apart into discrete changes and classified according to
                the keepachangelog.com standard. Then a human expert reviews the
                output. We can spend more time researching each package than you
                because we’re going to re-use this work for every future
                customer doing the same upgrade.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes you want to do a complex upgrade like Rails that might
                be blocked on other packages being upgraded first. For this case
                we run an optimization based on the PubGrub algorithm to solve
                for a suggested target version of all your dependencies that
                will be compatible with the next version of Rails. We group and
                order these blockers into an "Upgrade path" you can follow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the existing work in this space is security monitoring
                software like Dependabot or Snyk. These tools are primarily sold
                to security teams to let you know about CVEs that affect your
                dependencies. They’re reactive, a way to let developers know
                when they need to upgrade something but not how to do it. Our
                goal with Infield is to make it so easy to keep dependencies up
                to date that you’re always on the latest versions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Infield is $60/mo/repo and we’re launching today with support
                for Ruby. Javascript and Python are probably next, but we’re
                very interested to hear which language you feel this pain in
                most acutely. Ruby is first since the consolidation around Rails
                allows us to really nail the experience for a focused set of
                packages.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can try Infield on your own codebase at
                <a href="https://app.infield.ai/hn">https://app.infield.ai/hn</a
                >. With the paid plan we’ll hook into your codebase to
                continuously scan your dependencies as you merge PRs. That works
                via a Github app, or you can use our CLI tool to send us just
                the files we need as part of your CI pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please give it a try and comments are welcome! We’d love to hear
                everything you hate (or love, or just think) about dependency
                management and how we can make it better!

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                We've written a handbook about startup incorporation and I
                wanted to share it with all of you :)
              </p>
              <p>
                There is, of course, a lot of content about startup
                incorporation out there already. Why did we decide to add to the
                pile? Honestly, I often wince when I read what's out there,
                because so much of it is misguided or just plain wrong. A lot of
                it is people with no legal expertise regurgitating the same
                (often misguided / wrong) information they've read/heard
                elsewhere. Basically, the setup for the Gell-Mann amnesia
                effect, except the culprits are content marketers instead of the
                media.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also felt there was a need to have something comprehensive.
                While there's a lot of bad information out there, there is also
                a lot of great, accurate information. It's just usually spread
                across various blogs from startup attorneys, which makes it
                difficult to get a comprehensive view. With this handbook, our
                goal was to provide a central resource covering everything you
                need to know about startup incorporation.
              </p>
              <p>A few content-related notes:</p>
              <p>
                • We mention this in the handbook, but this is all written with
                US-based startups in mind. We fully recognize a lot of founders
                are elsewhere, but there's just too much to cover if we were to
                expand the scope to beyond the US. Sorry about that!
              </p>
              <p>
                • The word "startup" means different things to different people.
                We use the word in pretty much the way PG uses it here:
                <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html"
                  >http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                • As the name implies, this handbook is narrowly focused on
                startup incorporation. A lot of people don't know this, but
                there's a lot more to forming a startup than just incorporation,
                like setting up a board, issuing stock to founders, etc. We
                previously published a handbook called Legal Concepts for
                Founders, which touches on those topics:
                <a href="https://handbooks.clerky.com/legal-concepts"
                  >https://handbooks.clerky.com/legal-concepts</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                On more of a UI-related note, some personal pain points that we
                tried to address with our handbook design:
              </p>
              <p>
                • It's easy to jump down to a footnote and jump back up to where
                you came from (just click on the footnote number).
              </p>
              <p>
                • Every subheading is link-able, as are any callouts that you
                might want to link to.
              </p>
              <p>
                • We've been very generous with linking to glossary terms so
                that readers can quickly learn what they need to know in order
                to understand what they're reading. The challenge was that
                regular link styling would leave the copy way too busy. To solve
                for this, we made each link look super close to regular text so
                that the linking isn't distracting. That way readers that are
                puzzled by a term, who might be looking at it more closely
                anyways, will be able to click through and learn more, and other
                readers won't be distracted by the link styling.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd love to hear any thoughts or questions about either the
                content or the UI! I'll be here all day to respond. Also happy
                to answer random questions related to startup law.
              </p>
              <p>Thanks :)</p>

              <p>
                At our previous company, a student financing platform, we built
                several internal and external facing tools and encountered how
                tedious it can be to create and maintain myriads of APIs/CRUD
                operations. We especially felt that when building for edge cases
                and “what if” scenarios, as well as integrating with lots of
                third party services which receive, update and return data. In
                our case, a custom servicing platform which handled student
                repayments had to account for different student categories and
                repayment plans, while factoring in data we received from our
                KYC and ACH banking partners for each student. With Fastgen we
                try to eliminate boilerplate code and make it easier to adjust
                and share your work in a visual environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re low-code fans ourselves and believe it’s sometimes
                underappreciated how much complexity existing solutions can
                already handle, and we are excited to contribute to that market.
                The low-code space is crowded with front-end tools, but with a
                comparatively small number of backend tools. There is lots of
                busywork that comes with setting up a backend; we remove that
                busywork. Also, most low-code tools restrict users in what they
                are able to do. Our goal is to provide you with the flexibility
                and control inherent in coding, while still making it easier to
                use and faster to deploy.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Fastgen you sequence 'actions' to form rest APIs and
                workflows through a drag-and-drop interface. Actions are
                essentially functions that perform specific tasks such as
                sending an HTTP request, checking for conditions or interacting
                with a database.
              </p>
              <p>
                We support SQL for database operations, JSON for data structure,
                and comparison operators similar to JavaScript for
                decision-making in workflows. Everything you create can be
                deployed and tested instantly in the platform and will be hosted
                for you. Fastgen has a 'Debug Mode' that gives insights into the
                step-by-step execution of workflows. This aids in pinpointing
                issues and optimizing workflow performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                While some users have created backends for full MVPs with us,
                others use the platform to build automations for their
                data/operations teams. For example, one team was missing
                functionality in Pipedrive for their sales team, so they created
                a sequence of conditions and HTTP requests to the Pipedrive API
                to create their own custom lead recycling process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other things our users have done include the creation of KYC
                onboarding flows, a Chinese translation app using ChatGPT, an
                API that retrieves a company’s financial filings from the SEC
                for a crowdfunding platform, a cron job that checks for the
                health status of all other APIs in a code base, a categorizer of
                well performing product launches, a sitemap checker for a SEO
                project, and others.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would love for you to try out the platform and are excited
                for your thoughts and feedback in the comments!
