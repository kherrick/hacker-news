                >https://maritimefusion.com/</a
              >). We’re working on putting fusion reactors on
              ships—specifically, large container ships and defence
              applications. Should be easy!
              <p>
                Yes, we know: fusion has been the energy source of the
                future…and it always will be. But high-temperature
                superconductors (HTS) have changed the game for magnetic
                confinement, and we believe we’ll witness Q &gt; 1 within a few
                (say 3) years. That’s huge.
              </p>
              <p>
                (Side note: Q is the ratio of input power divided by output
                power. Q&gt; 1 means the reactor is producing more power than it
                consumes, achieving ‘breakeven.’)
              </p>
              <p>
                However, getting to breakeven is just the first daunting
                challenge. Making the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors
                cost-competitive on the grid? That might be even harder than
                achieving breakeven.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s why we’re taking this soon-to-be breakthrough in fusion
                and applying it to the first market we believe makes sense:
                ships.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of targeting 24/7 baseload grid electricity—where fusion
                has to compete with solar, wind, batteries, and natural
                gas—we’re focusing on large commercial shipping (&gt;10,000 TEU)
                and mobile military vessels to provide ship-to-shore power
                capability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why ships? They don’t have great alternatives—the shipping
                industry is desperate to decarbonize. Hydrogen and ammonia are
                being explored, but come with serious downsides: low energy
                density, flammability, leaks, and massive infrastructure
                challenges. Fusion will provide a high-energy-density,
                long-range solution without the same infrastructure
                challenges—once it works, of course!
              </p>
              <p>
                One common question is, why not fission? Fission works
                technically, but not practically. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
                <i>could</i> power ships, but licensing fission reactors on land
                is already brutally hard and expensive—doing it for vessels
                moving between international ports with enriched uranium is
                nearly impossible. Public perception is another major barrier:
                if we’re deploying thousands of nuclear reactors globally, they
                need to be meltdown-proof. Fusion is the only way to guarantee
                that. Regulation also isn’t as bad. While fusion won’t be a walk
                in the park to license, the NRC has declared a distinct
                framework for it—more like particle accelerators and hospitals
                than nuclear power plants. That’s a game-changer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of a 500+ MW grid-scale reactor, our system is 25 MWe,
                designed for ship propulsion. Our tokamak is roughly JET-sized,
                but with HTS magnets (8-9T) and higher plasma current (~10MA).
                The first-wall power flux is down from multi-MW/m² to nearly 500
                kW/m²—still tough, but not nightmare mode. The materials
                challenges associated with the first wall and nuclear activation
                of the structures is greatly reduced. Also, ships don’t require
                90% uptime like grid power plants. Downtime for maintenance is
                part of normal operations, making this a far more forgiving
                early application of fusion, unlike the grid where every down
                hour is lost revenue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jason and I come from SpaceX and Tesla, where we solved hard
                engineering problems at scale. My background is nuclear
                engineering (NC State, BS) and plasma physics (Columbia
                University, MS). We’ve been busy during our time in YC making
                technical progress on our reactor design, and are in the process
                of assembling a team of engineers who can pull this off.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a ridiculously hard problem, of course. But we think
                it’s the right hard problem—one that’s actually solvable (and
                worth solving!) with today’s tech if applied correctly.
                Eventually the cheaper and more robust SOAK and NOAK
                (second-of-a-kind and nth-of-a-kind) reactors will arrive in the
                coming decades (2050-2060) and then we'll pivot to decarbonising
                the grid and saving the world (we'll need to change our name),
                but until then we'll be out in the ocean!

                Would love to hear your thoughts—whether you’re deep into plasma
                physics and engineering, skeptical-but–curious, or convinced it
                will never work . Ask us anything!

                While this works, it was clunkier than what we would have wanted
                in a first-principles code execution product. We built ForeverVM
                from scratch to be that product.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, it felt clunky for app developers to have to
                think about sandboxes starting and stopping, so the core tenet
                of ForeverVM is using memory snapshotting to create the
                abstraction of a Python REPL that lives forever.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you go on our site, you are given a live Python repl, try
                it out!
              </p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>
                Edit: here's a bit more about why/when/how this can be used:
              </p>
              <p>
                LLMs are often given extra abilities through "tools", which are
                generally wrappers around API calls. For a lot of tasks (sending
                an email, fetching data from well-known sources), the LLM knows
                how to write Python code to accomplish the same.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any time the LLM needs to do a specific calculation or process
                data in a loop, we find it is better to generate code than try
                to do this in the LLM itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have an integration with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol,
                which is also supported by a lot of IDEs like Cursor and
                Windsurf. One surprising thing we've found is that once
                installed, when we ask a question about Python, the LLM will see
                that ForeverVM is available as a tool and verify it
                automatically! So we cut down on hallucinations that way.

                My girlfriend and I played a lot of the excellent LBreakoutHD,
                an open source breakout game that follows the traditional
                formula of having multiple lives, scoring points by breaking
                bricks and catching the good upgrades that spawn randomly and
                fall down, while avoiding bad upgrades.
              </p>
              <p>
                She liked this game because it is non-violent, and doesn't make
                her sick like the first person 3D games. There are some issues
                though, it gets boring to break the last bricks, it's a bit
                unfair or slow sometimes, and the run length is too long with 30
                something levels to clear for a high score.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to make a clone that would be fix those issues. I first
                tried to introduce more strategy by making the upgrades visible
                from the start, instead of them appearing randomly. You'd then
                strategize what to break first to earn more points. That first
                version is playable (<a href="https://breakout-v1.lecaro.me/"
                  >https://breakout-v1.lecaro.me/</a
                >) but a bit too complex.
              </p>
              <p>
                I then wanted to simplify the gameplay, but make the game
                multiplayer in split screen (<a
                  href="https://breakout-v2.lecaro.me/"
                  >https://breakout-v2.lecaro.me/</a
                >). Instead of bonus and malus, each brick drops some coins, and
                you need to catch them with the puck. This worked pretty well.
                You can play with the keyboard (A/D and LEFT/RIGHT keys) or
                mouse or both. The bomb explosions will blow coins around,
                including the coins of other players, and if you lose your ball,
                then a gap opens between your screen and the guy next to you, to
                give him a chance to lend you his ball. You can play using your
                phone as a controller by scanning the QR code, but make sure
                everyone is on the same Wi-Fi and that the the firewalls are
                down.
              </p>
              <p>
                For my last version (<a href="https://breakout.lecaro.me/"
                  >https://breakout.lecaro.me/</a
                >) is focused on the game feel and juice. It is about breaking
                bricks and catching coins, like the v2, but you can now pick
                upgrades at the end of each level. Your score unlocks more
                upgrades and levels that are added to the pool for the next
                runs. There are currently 31 upgrades and 91 levels to unlock.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please have a try and tell me what you think. The game should
                run well on Firefox, safari and chrome on mobile and pc. It is
                available in F-Droid and on the play store, The source code is
                on GitLab. All links are in the game menu.

                Tach lets you visualize the architecture of your Python
                codebase, and gives you the tools to incrementally improve it.
                It uses module boundaries to give teams the benefits of
                microservices without the deployment complexity.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your code has been getting tangled up as your team and
                codebase grows, Tach helps you move back in the right direction,
                incrementally and quickly. You can use Tach to incrementally
                adopt a "modular monolith" architecture [1], for better local
                reasoning and smoother feature development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since our last Show HN (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41359181"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41359181</a
                >) we've shipped support for layers, third party dependencies,
                visualizations, and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tach is: * Open source (MIT) * completely free * fast (written
                in Rust) * in use by teams at NVIDIA, PostHog, and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                One way Tach differs from existing systems that handle this
                problem (build systems, import linters, etc) is the ability to
                be incrementally adopted. Also, runtime speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you struggle with dependencies, onboarding new engineers, or
                a massive codebase, Tach is for you! We built it with developers
                in mind - with clean integrations into Git, CI/CD, and IDEs, and
                the performance for it to be effective in any form factor.

                Unlike many "open-core" alternatives that lock essential
                features behind enterprise plans, Libredesk is fully open-source
                and plans to always stay this way.

                It's in alpha (v0.1.0) right now, but there’s a working demo
                available. I built this because I wanted a truly open and
                self-hosted alternative to platforms like Chatwoot, Intercom,
                and Zendesk.

                The idea for this project came when I was having a long midnight
                conversation with my friend and thought of writing such a weird
                language. The initial draft was far worse than the current
                implementation; we thought of reversing the brackets and the
                language would be read from bottom to top. I'm happy that I
                dropped that idea
              </p>
              <p>
                Technical details: As the interpreter is written in Golang, I
                compiled it to WASM, and the whole interpreter is running in the
                browser. For the editor, I'm using Monaco, the same library that
                powers the text editor in VSCode. I learnt how to build it while
                reading "Write an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is opensourced -
