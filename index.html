                In essence it is a variant of the Kahn's algorithm. It has
                sufficient differences that I feel it deserves a separate
                explanation. It approaches the problem with node sets in a graph
                instead of individual nodes. This makes the central idea very
                simple. See the algorithm outline in the write up.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                Just over a year ago, we launched Hatchet as a distributed task
                queue built on top of Postgres with a 100% MIT license (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136</a
                >). The feedback and response we got from the HN community was
                overwhelming. In the first month after launching, we processed
                about 20k tasks on the platform — today, we’re processing over
                20k tasks per minute (&gt;1 billion per month).
              </p>
              <p>
                Scaling up this quickly was difficult — every task in Hatchet
                corresponds to at minimum 5 Postgres transactions and we would
                see bursts on Hatchet Cloud instances to over 5k tasks/second,
                which corresponds to roughly 25k transactions/second. As it
                turns out, a simple Postgres queue utilizing FOR UPDATE SKIP
                LOCKED doesn’t cut it at this scale. After provisioning the
                largest instance type that CloudSQL offers, we even discussed
                potentially moving some load off of Postgres in favor of
                something trendy like Clickhouse + Kafka.
              </p>
              <p>
                But we doubled down on Postgres, and spent about 6 months
                learning how to operate Postgres databases at scale and reading
                the Postgres manual and several other resources [0] during
                commutes and at night. We stuck with Postgres for two reasons:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. We wanted to make Hatchet as portable and easy to administer
                as possible, and felt that implementing our own storage engine
                specifically on Hatchet Cloud would be disingenuous at best, and
                in the worst case, would take our focus away from the open
                source community.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. More importantly, Postgres is general-purpose, which is what
                makes it both great but hard to scale for some types of
                workloads. This is also what allows us to offer a
                general-purpose orchestration platform — we heavily utilize
                Postgres features like transactions, SKIP LOCKED, recursive
                queries, triggers, COPY FROM, and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Which brings us to today. We’re announcing a full rewrite of the
                Hatchet engine — still built on Postgres — together with our
                task orchestration layer which is built on top of our underlying
                queue. To be more specific, we’re launching:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. DAG-based workflows that support a much wider array of
                conditions, including sleep conditions, event-based triggering,
                and conditional execution based on parent output data [1].
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Durable execution — durable execution refers to a function’s
                ability to recover from failure by caching intermediate results
                and automatically replaying them on a retry. We call a function
                with this ability a durable task. We also support durable sleep
                and durable events, which you can read more about here [2]
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Queue features such as key-based concurrency queues (for
                implementing fair queueing), rate limiting, sticky assignment,
                and worker affinity.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Improved performance across every dimension we’ve tested,
                which we attribute to six improvements to the Hatchet
                architecture: range-based partitioning of time series tables,
                hash-based partitioning of task events (for updating task
                statuses), separating our monitoring tables from our queue,
                buffered reads and writes, switching all high-volume tables to
                use identity columns, and aggressive use of Postgres triggers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've also removed RabbitMQ as a required dependency for
                self-hosting.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'd greatly appreciate any feedback you have and hope you get
                the chance to try out Hatchet.

              <p>
                In 2019, while contributing to the C2 language, I started up
                "C3" as a pet project while waiting for pull requests to be
                approved...
              </p>
              <p>
                Now it's 6 years later and C3 well on its way to 1.0, having
                released 0.7.0 last week.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike other C alternatives, C3 tries to evolve C – but without
                concern to backwards compatibility to the latter.
              </p>
              <p>What it adds to C is among other things:</p>
              <p>- Module system</p>
              <p>- Semantic macros and compile time introspection</p>
              <p>- Lightweight generic modules</p>
              <p>- Zero overhead errors</p>
              <p>- Build-in slices and SIMD types</p>
              <p>- Gradual contracts</p>
              <p>- Built-in checks in debug mode</p>
              <p>
                You can find more details on the site:
                <a href="https://c3-lang.org">https://c3-lang.org</a> It might
                be interesting to look at the examples:

                  >https://c3-lang.org/language-overview/examples/</a
                >
                so see how the language looks for some simple examples.

                window.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Malformed Requests: Custom HTTP/1.1 parser for sending quirky,
