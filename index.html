                I recently noticed a recurring visual artifact in the "Most
                Replayed" heatmap on the YouTube player. The highest peaks were
                always surrounded by two dips. I got curious about why they were
                there, so I decided to reverse engineer the feature to find out.
              </p>
              <p>
                This post documents the deep dive. It starts with a system
                design recreation, reverse engineering the rendering code, and
                ends with the mathematics.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is also my first attempt at writing an interactive article.
                I would love to hear your thoughts on the investigation and the
                format.

              <p>
                When working with BGP data, I kept running into the same
                friction: it’s easy to get raw data, but surprisingly hard to
                browse networks over time — especially by when they appeared,
                where they operate, and what they actually look like at a
                glance.
              </p>
              <p>I built a small tool, bgpscout.io, to scratch that itch.</p>
              <p>It lets you:</p>
              <p>Browse ASNs by registration date and geography</p>
              <p>See where a given network appears to have presence</p>
              <p>
                View commonly scattered public data about an ASN in one place
              </p>
              <p>
                Save searches to track when new networks matching certain
                criteria appear
              </p>
              <p>
                All of this data is public already; the goal was to make
                exploration faster and less painful.
              </p>
              <p>
                I haven’t invested heavily in expanding it yet. Before doing so,
                I’m curious:
              </p>
              <p>Is this solving a real problem for you?</p>
              <p>
                What would make something like this actually useful in
                day-to-day work?
              </p>

            <div class="text">
              <p>Wanted to show our open source agent harness called Gambit.</p>
              <p>
                If you’re not familiar, agent harnesses are sort of like an
                operating system for an agent... they handle tool calling,
                planning, context window management, and don’t require as much
                developer orchestration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Normally you might see an agent orchestration framework pipeline
                like:
              </p>
              <p>
                compute -&gt; compute -&gt; compute -&gt; LLM -&gt; compute
                -&gt; compute -&gt; LLM
              </p>
              <p>we invert this so with an agent harness, it’s more like:</p>
              <p>
                LLM -&gt; LLM -&gt; LLM -&gt; compute -&gt; LLM -&gt; LLM -&gt;
                compute -&gt; LLM
              </p>
              <p>
                Essentially you describe each agent in either a self contained
                markdown file, or as a typescript program. Your root agent can
                bring in other agents as needed, and we create a typesafe way
                for you to define the interfaces between those agents. We call
                these decks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agents can call agents, and each agent can be designed with
                whatever model params make sense for your task.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, each step of the chain gets automatic evals, we
                call graders. A grader is another deck type… but it’s designed
                to evaluate and score conversations (or individual conversation
                turns).
              </p>
              <p>
                We also have test agents you can define on a deck-by-deck basis,
                that are designed to mimic scenarios your agent would face and
                generate synthetic data for either humans or graders to grade.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to Gambit, we had built an LLM based video editor, and we
                weren’t happy with the results, which is what brought us down
                this path of improving inference time LLM quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know it’s missing some obvious parts, but we wanted to get
                this out there to see how it could help people or start
                conversations. We’re really happy with how it’s working with
                some of our early design partners, and we think it’s a way to
                implement a lot of interesting applications:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Truly open source agents and assistants, where logic, code,
                and prompts can be easily shared with the community.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Rubric based grading to guarantee you (for instance) don’t
                leak PII accidentally
              </p>
              <p>
                - Spin up a usable bot in minutes and have Codex or Claude Code
                use our command line runner / graders to build a first version
                that is pretty good w/ very little human intervention.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ll be around if ya’ll have any questions or thoughts. Thanks
                for checking us out!
              </p>

              <p>
                i built openwork, an open-source, local-first system inspired by
                claude cowork.
              </p>
              <p>
                it’s a native desktop app that runs on top of opencode
                (opencode.ai). it’s basically an alternative gui for opencode,
                which (at least until now) has been more focused on technical
                folks.
              </p>
              <p>
                the original seed for openwork was simple: i have a home server,
                and i wanted my wife and i to be able to run privileged
                workflows. things like controlling home assistant, or deploying
                custom web apps (e.g. our customs recipe app
                recipes.benjaminshafii.com), legal torrents, without living in a
                terminal.
              </p>
              <p>
                our initial setup was running the opencode web server directly
                and sharing credentials to it. that worked, but i found the web
                ui unreliable and very unfriendly for non-technical users.
              </p>
              <p>
                the goal with openwork is to bring the kind of workflows i’m
                used to running in the cli into a gui, while keeping a very deep
                extensibility mindset. ideally this grows into something closer
                to an obsidian-style ecosystem, but for agentic work.
              </p>
              <p>some core principles i had in mind:</p>
              <p>
                - open by design: no black boxes, no hosted lock-in. everything
                runs locally or on your own servers. (models don’t run locally
                yet, but both opencode and openwork are built with that future
                in mind.) - hyper extensible: skills are installable modules via
                a skill/package manager, using the native opencode plugin
                ecosystem. - non-technical by default: plans, progress,
                permissions, and artifacts are surfaced in the ui, not buried in
                logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                you can already try it: - there’s an unsigned dmg - or you can
                clone the repo, install deps, and if you already have opencode
                running it should work right away
              </p>
              <p>
                it’s very alpha, lots of rough edges. i’d love feedback on what
                feels the roughest or most confusing.
              </p>
              <p>happy to answer questions.</p>
