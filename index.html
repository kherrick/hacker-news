                I’d like to introduce PipeGate, a lightweight, self-hosted proxy
                built with FastAPI. I created PipeGate as a fun little exercise
                to understand how tunneling services work under the hood.
                PipeGate allows you to expose your local servers to the
                internet, giving you full control over your setup.

                In a recent "Ask HN: What are you working on?" thread, I
                mentioned I was working on OCRing a large book:
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41971614"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41971614</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The post generated some interest so I thought I would keep HN
                posted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The book is Saint-Simon’s Memoirs -- an invaluable historical
                account of the French court under Louis XIV, full of wit, sharp
                observations, and of incredible literary value. I'm OCRing the
                edition of reference made between 1879-1930, that contains a lot
                of comments and footnotes: 45 volumes, ~27,000 pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's a link to a blog post that describes the techniques used
                so far (the project is still ongoing):

                This web app (not optimized for mobile, sorry) solves a tricky
                problem of preloading images efficiently. In short: preloading
                the next image isn't enough, since browsers will repaint if an
                image is moved, or scaled. Or browsers won't paint at all if
                visibility is hidden or opacity is zero, and will paint only
                when those values change. On an average, slow machine, this
                takes visible time. But if an image is simply behind another
                element, it will be painted, and the removal of the covering
                element or changing the z-index will not trigger a repaint.
              </p>
              <p>
                (Preloading is important because it lets one review results
                fast; if one has to wait 150-200 ms between images it's simply
                discouraging).
              </p>
              <p>Would love to hear feedback; happy to answer any question!</p>

              <p>- One tool to ingest data</p>

              <p>- If you need to check the data, a data quality tool</p>
              <p>
                Let alone this being hard to set up and taking time, it is also
                pretty high-maintenance. I had to do a lot of infra work, and
                while this being billable hours for me I didn’t enjoy the work
                at all. For some parts of it, there were nice solutions like
                dbt, but in the end for an end-to-end workflow, it didn’t work.
                That’s why I decided to build an end-to-end solution that could
                take care of data ingestion, transformation, and Python stuff.
                Initially, it was just for our own usage, but in the end, we
                thought this could be a useful tool for everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                In its core, Bruin is a data framework that consists of a CLI
                application written in Golang, and a VS Code extension that
                supports it with a local UI.
              </p>
              <p>Bruin supports quite a few stuff:</p>
              <p>
                - Data ingestion using ingestr (<a
                  href="https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr"
                  >https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr</a
                >)
              </p>
              <p>- Data transformation in SQL &amp; Python, similar to dbt</p>
              <p>- Python env management using uv</p>
              <p>- Built-in data quality checks</p>
              <p>- Secrets management</p>
              <p>- Query validation &amp; SQL parsing</p>
              <p>
                - Built-in templates for common scenarios, e.g. Shopify, Notion,
                Gorgias, BigQuery, etc
              </p>
              <p>
                This means that you can write end-to-end pipelines within the
                same framework and get it running with a single command. You can
                run it on your own computer, on GitHub Actions, or in an EC2
                instance somewhere. Using the templates, you can also have
                ready-to-go pipelines with modeled data for your data warehouse
                in seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                It includes an open-source VS Code extension as well, which
                allows working with the data pipelines locally, in a more visual
                way. The resulting changes are all in code, which means
                everything is version-controlled regardless, it just adds a nice
                layer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bruin can run SQL, Python, and data ingestion workflows, as well
                as quality checks. For Python stuff, we use the awesome (and it
                really is awesome!) uv under the hood, install dependencies in
                an isolated environment, and install and manage the Python
                versions locally, all in a cross-platform way. Then in order to
                manage data uploads to the data warehouse, it uses dlt under the
                hood to upload the data to the destination. It also uses Arrow’s
                memory-mapped files to easily access the data between the

                We went with Golang because of its speed and strong concurrency
                primitives, but more importantly, I knew Go better than the
                other languages available to me and I enjoy writing Go, so
                there’s also that.
              </p>
              <p>
                We had a small pool of beta testers for quite some time and I am
                really excited to launch Bruin CLI to the rest of the world and
                get feedback from you all. I know it is not often to build data
                tooling in Go but I believe we found ourselves in a nice spot in
                terms of features, speed, and stability.

                With Langfuse, you can instrument your app and start ingesting
                traces, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in
                your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions.
                Langfuse then helps to analyze traces and use features such as
                evaluations or prompt management to make improvements to your
                app.

                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37310070</a
                >), thousands of teams adopted the project (including teams like
                KhanAcademy, Twilio, and Samsara) and we hit all of the scaling
                limits that we anticipated in the original Show HN thread. On
                our v1/v2 setup, we frequently exhausted IOPS on Postgres and
                had our Node.js container grind to a halt during tokenizations.
                Since then, we migrated our Cloud infrastructure from
                Vercel/Supabase to Porter and then to AWS &amp; Clickhouse. Last
                week, we put the finishing touches on the Langfuse v3.0.0
                release (<a
                  href="https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/releases/tag/v3.0.0"
                  >https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/releases/tag/v3.0.0</a
                >) that unlocks major scalability improvements we have made over
                the past half year and are happy to share with the OSS ecosystem
                today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Langfuse v3 addresses three challenges we encountered as an LLM
                observability platform: a) handling high ingestion throughput
                with large events (long strings, multimodal images/audio/video),
                b) providing fast analytical, table, and single-item reads
                across the product, and c) serving prompts quickly and reliably
                in the critical path of user’s applications. Langfuse is used by
                thousands of active self-hosting deployments, so at every point
                we needed to prioritize stability, fully automated
                migrations/upgrades, and use of infrastructure components that
                self-hosters can deploy freely on any cloud vendor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The v3 release adds powerful infrastructure with a Clickhouse
                database next to Postgres, blob storage for events and
                introduces a worker as well as queues and caches (Redis) for
                data ingestion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Langfuse SDKs were originally written to send updates to a
                single trace to our backend. The backend then upserts tracing
                data in Postgres. Dealing with these updates to guarantee
                backwards compatibility with older SDK versions was a challenge.
                Our ingestion pipeline writes all events into S3 and sends a
                reference to the file via Redis to our worker container. From
                there, we read all events with the same id (including all
                previously ingested ones) and merge them into a final event. We
                insert the new row into ClickHouse which automatically replaces
                the existing data for the same ID. Re-merging all event updates
                enables us to keep a high-throughput pipeline by converting
                updates into new insert-only records.
              </p>
              <p>
                We ran many iterations to optimize our sorting keys in
                ClickHouse, use skip indexes efficiently, and rewrote almost all
                of our queries and API endpoints to make optimal use of the
                schema. Using a specialized, analytical database required a more
                database-centric application design than a swiss-army-knife
                database like Postgres.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new infrastructure delivers dramatic performance gains:
                dashboards now respond within 400ms (95th percentile) instead of
                timing out on large projects and lookback windows, and tables
                load up to 90% faster - displaying data within 800ms even for
                the largest projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, to serve prompts from prompt management with
                low-latency and high availability, we use caches heavily and
                also decoupled our infrastructure. For sensitive paths, we use
                dedicated deployments to avoid “noisy neighbors” within the same
                server. We also improved client-side caching in our SDKs. This
                enhancement allows them to prefetch prompts and revalidate them
                in the background, resulting in zero latency when retrieving a
                prompt at runtime.
              </p>

              <p>and it's all being shut down.</p>
              <p>
                the UK Online Safety Act creates a massive liability, and whilst
                at first glance the risk seems low the reality is that
                moderating people usually provokes ire from those people, if we
                had to moderate them because they were a threat to the community
                then they are usually the kind of people who get angry.
              </p>
              <p>
                in 28 years of running forums, as a result of moderation I've
                had people try to get the domain revoked, fake copyright
                notices, death threats, stalkers (IRL and online)... as a forum
                moderator you are known, and you are a target, and the Online
                Safety Act creates a weapon that can be used against you. the
                risk is no longer hypothetical, so even if I got lawyers
                involved to be compliant I'd still have the liability and risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                in over 28 years I've run close to 500 fora in total, and
                they've changed so many lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created them to provide a way for those without families to
                build families, to catch the waifs and strays, and to try to
                hold back loneliness, depression, and the risk of isolation and
                suicide... and it worked, it still works.
              </p>
              <p>
                but on 17th March 2025 it will become too much, no longer
                tenable, the personal liability and risks too significant.
              </p>
              <p>
                I guess I'm just the first to name a date, and now we'll watch
                many small communities slowly shutter.
              </p>
              <p>
                the Online Safety Act was supposed to hold big tech to account,
                but in fact they're the only ones who will be able to comply...
                it consolidates more on those platforms.
