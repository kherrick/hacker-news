                There are many simplifications and shortcuts taken (doesn't even
                have task priorities), and it doesn't map 1:1 to true
                multithreading (e.g., emulator save states represent the state
                of the entire machine including RAM, whereas thread contexts
                represent a much more minimal slice), but I think it's A) pretty
                interesting and B) a unique visceral explanation of threads.

              <p>TLDR; rebuilding in Rust was the right move.</p>
              <p>
                So we rewrote the app with Rust and Tauri and here are the
                results:
              </p>
              <p>
                - App size is 83% smaller: 1GB → 172MB - DMG Installer is 70%
                smaller: 232MB → 69.5MB - Indexing files is faster: A 38-minute
                video now indexes in ~3 minutes instead of 10-14 minutes -
                Overall more stability (old app used to randomly crash)
              </p>
              <p>
                The original version worked, but it didn't perform well when you
                tried indexing thousands of images or large videos. We lost a
                lot of time struggling to optimize Electron’s main-renderer
                process communication and ended up with a complex worker system
                to process large batches of media files.
              </p>
              <p>
                For months we wrestled with indecision about continuing to
                optimize the Electron app vs. starting a full rebuild in Swift
                or Rust. The main thing holding us back was that we hadn’t coded
                in Swift in almost 10 years and we didn’t know Rust very well.
              </p>
              <p>
                What finally broke us was when users complained the app crashed
                their video calls just running in background. I guess that’s
                what happens when you ship an app with Chromium that takes up
                200mb before any application code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today the app still uses CLIP for embeddings and Redis for
                vector storage and search, except Rust now handles the image and
                video processing pipeline and all the file I/O to let users
                browse their entire machine, not just indexed files.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the UI, we decided to rebuild it from scratch instead of
                porting over the old UI. This turned out well because it
                resulted in a cleaner, simpler UI after living with the
                complexity of the old version.
              </p>
              <p>
                The trickiest part of the migration was learning Rust. LLMs
                definitely help, but the Rust/Tauri community just isn’t as
                mature compared to Electron. Bundling Redis into the app was a
                permissioning nightmare, but I think our solution with Rust
                handles this better than what we had with Electron.
              </p>
              <p>
                All in, the rebuild took about two months and still needs some
                more work to be at total parity with its Electron version, but
                the core functionality of indexing and searching files is way
                more performant than before and that made it worth the time.
                Sometimes you gotta throw away working code to build the right
                thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                AMA about Rust/Tauri migration, Redis bundling nightmares, how
                CLIP embeddings work for local semantic search, or why Electron
                isn't always the answer.

              <a href="https://mindfort.ai">https://mindfort.ai</a>). We're
              building autonomous AI agents that continuously find, validate,
              and patch security vulnerabilities in web applications—essentially
              creating an AI red team that runs 24/7.
              <p>
                Here's a demo:

                Security testing today is increasingly challenging. Traditional
                scanners generate 30-50% false positives, drowning engineering
                teams in noise. Manual penetration testing happens quarterly at
                best, costs tens of thousands per assessment, and takes weeks to
                complete. Meanwhile, teams are shipping code faster than ever
                with AI assistance, but security reviews have become an even
                bigger bottleneck.
              </p>
              <p>
                All three of us encountered this problem from different angles.
                Brandon worked at ProjectDiscovery building the Nuclei scanner,
                then at NetSPI (one of the largest pen testing firms) building
                AI tools for testers. Sam was a senior engineer at Salesforce
                leading security for Tableau. He dealt firsthand with juggling
                security findings and managing remediations. Akul did his
                master's on AI and security, co-authored papers on using LLMs
                for ecurity attacks, and participated in red-teams at OpenAI and
                Anthropic.
              </p>
              <p>
                We all realized that AI agents were going to fundamentally
                change security testing, and that the wave of AI-generated code
                would need an equally powerful solution to keep it secure.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've built AI agents that perform reconnaissance, exploit
                vulnerabilities, and suggest patches—similar to how a human
                penetration tester works. The key difference from traditional
                scanners is that our agents validate exploits in runtime
                environments before reporting them, reducing false positives.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use multiple foundational models orchestrated together. The
                agents perform recon to understand the attack surface, then use
                that context to inform testing strategies. When they find
                potential vulnerabilities, they spin up isolated environments to
                validate exploitation. If successful, they analyze the codebase
                to generate contextual patches.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes this different from existing tools? Validation
                through exploitation: We don't just pattern-match—we exploit
                vulnerabilities to prove they're real; - Codebase integration:
                The agents understand your code structure to find complex logic
                bugs and suggest appropriate fixes; - Continuous operation:
                Instead of point-in-time assessments, we're constantly testing
                as your code evolves; - Attack chain discovery: The agents can
                find multi-step vulnerabilities that require chaining different
                issues together.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're currently in early access, working with initial partners
                to refine the platform. Our agents are already finding
                vulnerabilities that other tools miss and scoring well on
                penetration testing benchmarks.

              <p>
                Early in my career, I worked on enterprise auth and security
                features at Segment. I've been obsessed with the subtle details
                of enterprise software ever since. For example, I wrote an
                implementation of SAML in the early days of the COVID pandemic
                because I thought it was fun.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, I've felt frustrated that too few people have
                seemed interested in making auth obvious for developers of
                business software. Auth really doesn't need to be so confusing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We made Tesseral to help software engineers get B2B auth exactly
                right – and focus their energy on building the features that
                users want.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use Tesseral to stand up a login page, authenticate your
                users, and manage their access to resources. Think of it like
                Auth0 or Clerk, but open source and built specifically for B2B
                apps. Among other things, that means that it’s designed for B2B
                multi-tenancy and includes enterprise-ready features like single
                sign-on (SAML SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), SCIM
                provisioning, and role-based access control (RBAC).
              </p>
              <p>
                For those who expose public APIs, you can use Tesseral to manage
                API keys for your customers. You can even limit the scope of API
                keys to specific actions by using our RBAC feature.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've taken care to make Tesseral powerful and secure enough to
                power real enterprise software but still leave it simple enough
                for any software developer to use. You don't have to be a
                security expert to implement Tesseral. (By default, therefore,
                Tesseral imposes a few opinions. Let us know if you have a good
                reason to do something unusual, and we'll work something out.)
              </p>

                yourself or use our hosted service. The hosted service lives at

                We're in the early stages of the project, so we still have some
                gaps. We have more features, bug fixes, SDKs, and documentation
                on the way.

                What have we missed? What can we do better? We're eager to hear

                Wetlands not only simplifies the creation of isolated Conda
                environments with specific dependencies, but also allows you to
                run arbitrary Python code within those environments and retrieve
                the results. It uses the multiprocessing.connection and pickle
                modules for inter-process communication. Additionally, one can
                easily use shared memory between the environments, making data
                exchange more efficient.

                I posted here some years ago trying to raise money for a
                Kickstarter for a product I call Loodio.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loodio is a motion activated music player for bathrooms that
                plays music during the bathroom visit to give users privacy
                during their sacred moments.
              </p>
              <p>
                The kickstarter failed, but I managed to create a product
                eventually with a lot of effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                I managed to sell 150 units of the first unit, mostly to United
                States but to all different parts of the world while working on
                the next version.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem with the first version was that it was running on a
                Raspberry Pi Zero W (that had to be wall connected) and it was
                pretty big, had crappy sound and took a minute to start since it
                had to boot a whole linux system. I was running it on a python
                script and unix services. To add music, people had to SSH into
                the unit so you can imagine how painful that was for some.
              </p>
              <p>
                However customers loved it! But I knew I could do better. The
                most common request was battery operation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some reviews of version 1:

              </p>
              <p>
                I'm proud to say that Loodio 2 is finally here and is working
                like I imagined when I started working on it almost 5 years ago
                now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loodio 2 introduces battery operation with 1 week of battery
                life (~5 hours of active operation). It has great sound and an
                easy way to add your own music with SD card support (4GB
                included).
              </p>
              <p>
                It doesn't require any app. Can be run without WiFi (however you
                lose some features like internet radio, time updates, software
                updates and weather)
              </p>
              <p>
                Why does it have a display, you may ask? Because, I used to have
                an electric toothbrush that came with a display. That display
                showed how long you were brushing to make sure you did your 2
                minutes per brush. When I wasn't brushing my teeth, it showed
                the current time. And I stopped using the electric tooth brush
                (because a dentist told me they are too harsh on your teeth) but
                kept the display for probably 5 years afterwards because I
                noticed I really want to know the time while getting ready for
                school/work in the morning. Another thing I noticed was that I
                always check the weather outside, so I could dress
                appropriately.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, Loodio shows you the time and weather (optionally) as well
                as playing music during your visit. These features together with
                the lights, are features that I think people don't expect to use
                but with time becomes as important as the music. Customer
                interviews verify this.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wasted a lot of money trying to outsource the development the
                first 18 months. I then decided to start doing it myself. The
                version I'm selling is actually the 25th(!) iteration of the
                product. The problem with hardware is that it takes you around a
                month to iterate a circuit (if you don't live next to the
                factory in Shenzhen) because of the cycle 'Designing-&gt;Order
                from China-&gt;Testing-&gt;Repeat'. And I had no experience of
                electronics when starting out.
              </p>
              <p>
                The enclosure is made from empty PCBs to save money for
                injection tooling later. It looks pretty cool. But mainly, works
                great!
              </p>
              <p>
                I want to give credit to Tadeusz Karpinski and Velimir Stoleski
                that ported my crappy python script to the ESP32 that is running
                Loodio 2.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need to try it! I really think you're gonna like it!

                The core idea: instead of giving every query the same "thinking
                time," classify queries as HIGH or LOW complexity and allocate
                thinking tokens accordingly. Complex reasoning gets 70-90% of
                tokens, simple queries get 20-40%.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also implemented steering vectors derived from Pivotal Token
                Search (originally from Microsoft's Phi-4 paper) that guide the
                model's reasoning patterns during generation. These vectors
                encourage behaviors like numerical accuracy, self-correction,
                and thorough exploration.
              </p>
              <p>Results on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B:</p>
              <p>
                - GPQA-Diamond: 31.06% vs 21.72% baseline (+43% relative
                improvement)
              </p>
              <p>- MMLU-Pro: 26.38% vs 25.58% baseline</p>
              <p>- Uses fewer tokens than baseline approaches</p>
              <p>
                Works with any local reasoning model - DeepSeek, Qwen, custom
                fine-tuned models. No API dependencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The technique builds on two things I developed: an adaptive
                classification framework that can learn new complexity
                categories without retraining, and an open source implementation
                of Pivotal Token Search.

                I'm curious about your thoughts on adaptive resource allocation
                for AI reasoning. Have you tried similar approaches with your
                local models?
