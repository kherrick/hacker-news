              <p>
                Most AI agent frameworks target code. Write code, run tests, fix
                errors, repeat. That works because code has a natural
                verification signal. It works or it doesn't.
              </p>
              <p>This SDK treats knowledge work like an engineering problem:</p>
              <p>
                Task → Brief → Rubric (hidden from executor) → Work → Verify →
                Fail? → Retry → Pass → Submit
              </p>
              <p>
                The orchestrator coordinates subagents, web search, code
                execution, and file I/O. then checks its own work against
                criteria it can't game (the rubric is generated in a separate
                call and the executor never sees it directly).
              </p>
              <p>
                We originally built this as a harness for RL training on
                knowledge tasks. The rubric is the reward function. If you're
                training models on knowledge work, the
                brief→rubric→execute→verify loop gives you a structured reward
                signal for tasks that normally don't have one.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes Knowledge work different from code? (apart from
                feedback loop) I believe there is some functionality missing
                from today's agents when it comes to knowledge work. I tried to
                include that in this release. Example:
              </p>
              <p>
                Explore mode: Mapping the solution space, identifying the set
                level gaps, and giving options.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most agents optimize for a single answer, and end up with a
                median one. For strategy, design, creative problems, you want to
                see the options, what are the tradeoffs, and what can you do?
                Explore mode generates N distinct approaches, each with explicit
                assumptions and counterfactuals ("this works if X, breaks if
                Y"). The output ends with set-level gaps ie what angles the
                entire set missed. The gaps are often more valuable than the
                takes. I think this is what many of us do on a daily basis, but
                no agent directly captures it today. See
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/explore_mode.py"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/explore_...</a
                >
                and the output for a sense of how this is different.
              </p>
              <p>
                Checkpointing: With many ai agents and especially multi agent
                systems, i can see where it went wrong, but cant run inference
                from same stage. (or you may want multiple explorations once an
                agent has done some tasks like search and is now looking at
                ideas). I used this for rollouts a lot, and think its a great
                feature to run again, or fork from a specific checkpoint.
              </p>
              <p>
                A note on Verification loop: The verify step is where the real
                leverage is. A model that can accurately assess its own work
                against a rubric is more valuable than one that generates
                slightly better first drafts. The rubric makes quality legible —
                to the agent, to the human, and potentially to a training
                signal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some things i like about this: - You can pass a remote execution
                environment (including your browser as a sandbox) and it would
                work. It can be docker, e2b, your local env, anything, the model
                will execute commands in your context, and will iterate based on
                feedback loop. Code execution is a protocol here.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Tool calling: I realize you don't need complex functions.
                Models are good at writing terminal code, and can iterate based
                on feedback, so you can just pass either functions in context
                and model will execute or you can pass docs and model will write
                the code. (same as anthropic's programmatic tool calling).
                Details:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/TOOL_CALLING_GUIDE.md"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/TOOL_CALLING_GUID...</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, some guides: - SDK guide:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/SDK_GUIDE.md"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/SDK_GUIDE.md</a
                >
                - Extensible. See bizarro example where i add a new mode:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/custom_mode_bizarro.py"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/custom_m...</a
                >
                - working with files:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/with_files.py"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/with_fil...</a
                >
                - this is simple but i love the csv example:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/csv_research_and_calc.py"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/csv_rese...</a
                >
                - remote execution:
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/with_custom_executor.py"
                  >https://github.com/ClioAI/kw-sdk/blob/main/examples/with_cus...</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                And a lot more. This was completely refactored by opus and given
                the rework, probably would have taken a lot of time to release
                it.
              </p>

                knowledge work, but they’re only as useful as the context they
                have. Rowboat is an open-source, local-first app that turns your
                work into a living knowledge graph (stored as plain Markdown
                with backlinks) and uses it to accomplish tasks on your
                computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, you can say "Build me a deck about our next quarter
                roadmap." Rowboat pulls priorities and commitments from your
                graph, loads a presentation skill, and exports a PDF.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our repo is
                <a href="https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat"
                  >https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat</a
                >, and there’s a demo video here:

                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>Rowboat has two parts:</p>
              <p>
                (1) A living context graph: Rowboat connects to sources like
                Gmail and meeting notes like Granola and Fireflies, extracts
                decisions, commitments, deadlines, and relationships, and writes
                them locally as linked and editable Markdown files
                (Obsidian-style), organized around people, projects, and topics.
                As new conversations happen (including voice memos), related
                notes update automatically. If a deadline changes in a standup,
                it links back to the original commitment and updates it.
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) A local assistant: On top of that graph, Rowboat includes an
                agent with local shell access and MCP support, so it can use
                your existing context to actually do work on your machine. It
                can act on demand or run scheduled background tasks. Example:
                “Prep me for my meeting with John and create a short voice
                brief.” It pulls relevant context from your graph and can
                generate an audio note via an MCP tool like ElevenLabs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why not just search transcripts? Passing gigabytes of email,
                docs, and calls directly to an AI agent is slow and lossy. And
                search only answers the questions you think to ask. A system
                that accumulates context over time can track decisions,
                commitments, and relationships across conversations, and surface
                patterns you didn't know to look for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rowboat is Apache-2.0 licensed, works with any LLM (including
                local ones), and stores all data locally as Markdown you can
                read, edit, or delete at any time.
              </p>

                Our previous startup was acquired by Coinbase, where part of my
                work involved graph neural networks. We're excited to be working
                with graph-based systems again. Work memory feels like the
                missing layer for agents.

              <p>
                It turned out things get messy when your software is running in
                places you can't simply SSH into.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the last year, we’ve also helped modernize a lot of
                home-baked solutions: bash scripts that email when updates fail,
                Excel sheets nobody trusts to track customer versions, engineers
                driving to customer sites to fix things in person, debug
                sessions over email (“can you take a screenshot of the logs and
                send it to me?”), customers with access to internal AWS or GCP
                registries because there was no better option, and deployments
                two major versions behind that nobody wants to touch.
              </p>
              <p>
                We waited a year before making our first breaking change, which
                led to a major SemVer update—but it was eventually necessary. We
                needed to completely rewrite how we manage customer
                organizations. In Distr, we differentiate between vendors and
                customers. A vendor is typically the author of a software / AI
                application that wants to distribute it to customers.
                Previously, we had taken a shortcut where every customer was
                just a single user who owned a deployment. We’ve now introduced
                customer organizations. Vendors onboard customer organizations
                onto the platform, and customers own their internal user
                management, including RBAC. This change obviously broke our API,
                and although the migration for our cloud customers was smooth,
                custom solutions built on top of our APIs needed updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other notable features we’ve implemented since our first launch:
              </p>
              <p>
                - An OCI container registry built on an adapted version of
                <a href="https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/"
                  >https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/</a
                >, directly embedded into our codebase and served via a separate
                port from a single Docker image. This allows vendors to
                distribute Docker images and other OCI artifacts if customers
                want to self-manage deployments.
              </p>
              <p>
                - License Management to restrict which customers can access
                which applications or artifact versions. Although “license
                management” is a broadly used term, the main purpose here is to
                codify contractual agreements between vendors and customers. In
                its simplest form, this is time-based access to specific
                software versions, which vendors can now manage with Distr.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Container logs and metrics you can actually see without SSH
                access. Internally, we debated whether to use a time-series
                database or store all logs in Postgres. Although we had to
                tinker quite a bit with Postgres indexes, it now runs stably.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Secret Management, so database passwords don’t show up in
                configuration steps or logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distr is now used by 200+ vendors, including Fortune 500
                companies, across on-prem, GovCloud, AWS, and GCP, spanning
                health tech, fintech, security, and AI companies. We’ve also
                started working on our first air-gapped environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Distr 3.0, we’re working on native Terraform / OpenTofu and

              <p>
                I live in the CLI, but for discovery and ongoing monitoring, I
                kept bouncing between tools, terminals, and mental context
                switches. I wanted something faster and more visual, without
                losing technical depth — so I built a GUI that brings my
                favorite diagnostics together in one place.
              </p>
              <p>
                About three months ago, I shared an early version here and got a
                ton of great feedback. I listened: a new name (it was
                PingStalker), a longer trial, and a lot of new features. Today
                I’m excited to share NetViews 2.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                NetViews started because I wanted to know if something on the
                network was scanning my machine. Once I had that, I wanted quick
                access to core details—external IP, Wi-Fi data, and local
                topology. Then I wanted more: fast, reliable scans using ARP
                tables and ICMP.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a Wi-Fi engineer, I couldn’t stop there. I kept adding ways
                to surface what’s actually going on behind the scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Discovery &amp; Scanning: * ARP, ICMP, mDNS, and DNS discovery
                to enumerate every device on your subnet (IP, MAC, vendor, open
                ports). * Fast scans using ARP tables first, then ICMP, to avoid
                the usual “nmap wait”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wireless Visibility: * Detailed Wi-Fi connection performance and
                signal data. * Visual and audible tools to quickly locate the
                access point you’re associated with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Monitoring &amp; Timelines: * Connection and ping timelines over
                1, 2, 4, or 8 hours. * Continuous “live ping” monitoring to
                visualize latency spikes, packet loss, and reconnects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Low-level Traffic (but only what matters): * Live capture of
                DHCP, ARP, 802.1X, LLDP/CDP, ICMP, and off-subnet chatter. *
                mDNS decoded into human-readable output (this took months of
                deep dives).
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, it’s written in Swift. It uses low-level BSD
                sockets for ICMP and ARP, Apple’s Network framework for
                interface enumeration, and selectively wraps existing
                command-line tools where they’re still the best option. The
                focus has been on speed and low overhead.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’d love feedback from anyone who builds or uses network
                diagnostic tools: - Does this fill a gap you’ve personally hit
                on macOS? - Are there better approaches to scan speed or event
                visualization that you’ve used? - What diagnostics do you still
                find yourself dropping to the CLI for?
              </p>
