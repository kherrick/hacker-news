                Flowglad is a payment processor that you integrate without
                writing any glue code. Along with processing your payments, it
                tells you in real time the features and usage credit balances
                that your customers have available to you based on their billing
                state. The DX feels like React, because we wanted to bring the
                reactive programming paradigm to payments.
              </p>
              <p>
                We make it easy to spin up full-fledged pricing models
                (including usage meters, feature gates and usage credit grants)
                in a few clicks. We schematize these pricing models into a
                pricing.yaml file that’s kinda like Terraform but for your
                pricing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result is a payments layer that AI coding agents have a
                substantially easier time one-shotting (for now the happiest
                path is a fullstack Typescript + React app).
              </p>
              <p>Why we built this:</p>
              <p>
                - After a decade of building on Stripe, we found it powerful but
                underopinionated. It left us doing a lot of rote work to set up
                fairly standard use cases - That meant more code to maintain,
                much of which is brittle because it crosses so many
                server-client boundaries - Not to mention choreographing the
                lifecycle of our business domain with the Stripe checkout flow
                and webhook event types, of which there are 250+ - Payments
                online has gotten complex - not just new pricing models for AI
                products, but also cross border sales tax, etc. You either need
                to handle significant chunks of it yourself, or sign up for and
                compose multiple services
              </p>
              <p>
                This all feels unduly clunky, esp when compared to how easy
                other layers like hosting and databases have gotten in recent
                years.
              </p>
              <p>
                These patterns haven’t changed much in a decade. And while
                coding agents can nail every other rote part of an app (auth,
                db, analytics), payments is the scariest to tab-tab-tab your way
                through. Because the the existing integration patterns are
                difficult to reason about, difficult to verify correctness, and
                absolutely mission critical.
              </p>
              <p>Our beta version lets you:</p>
              <p>
                - Spin up common pricing models in just a few clicks, and
                customize them as needed - Clone pricing models between testmode
                and live mode, and import / export via pricing.yaml - Check
                customer usage credits and feature access in real time on your
                backend and React frontend - Integrate without any DB schema
                changes - you reference your customers via your ids, and
                reference prices, products, features and usage meters via slugs
                that you define
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re still early in our journey so would love your feedback and
                opinions. Billing has a lot of use cases, so if you see anything
                that you wish we supported, please let us know!

              <p>
                Two years ago, Yuhong and I had the same recurring problem. We
                were on growing teams and it was ridiculously difficult to find
                the right information across our docs, Slack, meeting notes,
                etc. Existing solutions required sending out our company's data,
                lacked customization, and frankly didn't work well. So, we
                started Danswer, an open-source enterprise search project built
                to be self-hosted and easily customized.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the project grew, we started seeing an interesting trend—even
                though we were explicitly a search app, people wanted to use
                Danswer just to chat with LLMs. We’d hear, “the connectors,
                indexing, and search are great, but I’m going to start by
                connecting GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Qwen to provide my team
                with a secure way to use them”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many users would add RAG, agents, and custom tools later, but
                much of the usage stayed ‘basic chat’. We thought: “why would
                people co-opt an enterprise search when other AI chat solutions
                exist?”
              </p>
              <p>
                As we continued talking to users, we realized two key points:
              </p>
              <p>
                (1) just giving a company secure access to an LLM with a great
                UI and simple tools is a huge part of the value add of AI
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) providing this <i>well</i> is much harder than you might
                think and the bar is incredibly high
              </p>
              <p>
                Consumer products like ChatGPT and Claude already provide a
                great experience—and chat with AI for work is something
                (ideally) everyone at the company uses 10+ times per day. People
                expect the same snappy, simple, and intuitive UX with a full
                feature set. Getting hundreds of small details right to take the
                experience from “this works” to “this feels magical” is not
                easy, and nothing else in the space has managed to do it.
              </p>
              <p>
                So ~3 months ago we pivoted to Onyx, the open-source chat UI
                with:
              </p>
              <p>
                - (truly) world class chat UX. Usable both by a fresh college
                grad who grew up with AI and an industry veteran who’s using AI
                tools for the first time.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Support for all the common add-ons: RAG, connectors, web
                search, custom tools, MCP, assistants, deep research.
              </p>
              <p>
                - RBAC, SSO, permission syncing, easy on-prem hosting to make it
                work for larger enterprises.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through building features like deep research and code
                interpreter that work across model providers, we've learned a
                ton of non-obvious things about engineering LLMs that have been
                key to making Onyx work. I'd like to share two that were
                particularly interesting (happy to discuss more in the
                comments).
              </p>
              <p>
                First, context management is one of the most difficult and
                important things to get right. We’ve found that LLMs really
                struggle to remember both system prompts and previous user
                messages in long conversations. Even simple instructions like
                “ignore sources of type X” in the system prompt are very often
                ignored. This is exacerbated by multiple tool calls, which can
                often feed in huge amounts of context. We solved this problem
                with a “Reminder” prompt—a short 1-3 sentence blurb injected at
                the end of the user message that describes the non-negotiables
                that the LLM must abide by. Empirically, LLMs attend most to the
                very end of the context window, so this placement gives the
                highest likelihood of adherence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, we’ve needed to build an understanding of the “natural
                tendencies” of certain models when using tools, and build around
                them. For example, the GPT family of models are fine-tuned to
                use a python code interpreter that operates in a Jupyter
                notebook. Even if told explicitly, it refuses to add `print()`
                around the last line, since, in Jupyter, this last line is
                automatically written to stdout. Other models don’t have this
                strong preference, so we’ve had to design our model-agnostic
                code interpreter to also automatically `print()` the last bare
                line.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far, we’ve had a Fortune 100 team fork Onyx and provide 10k+
                employees access to every model within a single interface, and
                create thousands of use-case specific Assistants for every
                department, each using the best model for the job. We’ve seen
                teams operating in sensitive industries completely airgap Onyx
                w/ locally hosted LLMs to provide a copilot that wouldn’t have
                been possible otherwise.
              </p>

                You can submit text posts and links, just like the real HN. But
                on HN Simulator, all of the comments are generated by LLMs +
                generate instantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best way to use it (IMHO) is to submit a text post or a
                curl-able URL here:
                <a href="https://news.ysimulator.run/submit"
                  >https://news.ysimulator.run/submit</a
                >. You don't need an account to post.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you do that, various prompts will be built from a library
                of commenter archetypes, moods, and shapes. The AI commenters
                will actually respond to your text post and/or submitted link.
              </p>
              <p>
                I really wanted it to feel real, and I think the project mostly
                delivers on that. When I was developing it, I kept getting
                confused between which tab was the "real" HN and which was the
                simulator, and accidentally submitted some junk to HN. (Sorry
                dang and team – I did clean up after myself).
              </p>
              <p>
                The app itself is built with Node + Express + Postgres, and all
                of the inference runs on Replicate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Speaking of Replicate, they generously loaded me up with some
                free credits for the inference – so shoutout to the team there.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most technically interesting part of the app is how the
                comments work. You can read more about it here, as well as
                explore all of the available archetypes, moods, and shapes that
                get combined into prompts:

                it!
