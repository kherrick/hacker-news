              <p>
                A few of our team members at Airbyte (and Joe, who killed it!)
                recently played with building our own internal support chat bot,
                using Airbyte, Langchain, Pinecone and OpenAI, that would answer
                any questions we ask when developing a new connector on Airbyte.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we prototyped it, we realized that it could be applied for
                many other use cases and sources of data, so... we created a
                tutorial that other community members can leverage [<a
                  href="http://airbyte.com/tutorials/chat-with-your-data-using-openai-pinecone-airbyte-and-langchain"
                  >http://airbyte.com/tutorials/chat-with-your-data-using-opena...</a
                >] and the Github repo to run it [<a
                  href="https://github.com/airbytehq/tutorial-connector-dev-bot"
                  >https://github.com/airbytehq/tutorial-connector-dev-bot</a
                >]
              </p>
              <p>
                The tutorial shows: - How to extract unstructured data from a
                variety of sources using Airbyte Open Source - How to load data
                into a vector database (here Pinecone), preparing the data for
                LLM usage along the way - How to integrate a vector database
                into ChatGPT to ask questions about your proprietary data
              </p>
              <p>I hope some of it is useful, and would love your feedback!</p>

              <a href="https://stellarsleep.com/">https://stellarsleep.com/</a
              >). We spent the past 1.5 years developing an app that helps
              people break the insomnia cycle using psychology.
              <p>
                Insomnia has been a personal struggle for both of us. George’s
                insomnia led to him quantifying his sleep for the last 7 years
                and making questionable life choices like wearing orange
                (blue-light blocking) goggles to evening social events.
              </p>
              <p>
                I (Ed) suffered from chronic insomnia for over a year and tried
                everything from cutting coffee, blocking blue light, to taking
                melatonin and antihistamine, but couldn’t find anything that
                worked. It took an immense amount of energy for me to perform
                even the most mundane of tasks, such as doing my laundry or
                ordering groceries. At night, I felt overwhelming loneliness and
                resentment as I lay in bed wide awake, mindlessly scrolling
                through reddit and browsing HN in the middle of the night. I
                even bought a $500 research-grade EEG device to track my sleep,
                which was honestly kind of depressing because it showed that I
                was sleeping less than 4 hours per night for weeks straight.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I finally decided to see a sleep specialist, I was put on a
                3-month long waiting list. Eventually, I was able to get my
                insomnia treated. That finally helped. But it also made me
                realize that the same therapy that I received could be delivered
                online—there is no reason why anyone should have to wait 3
                months to get treatment. George and I both have experience in
                digital health, so we decided to partner with sleep experts to
                create Stellar Sleep.
              </p>
              <p>
                People with chronic insomnia often receive inadequate care
                advice. They’re told to try cutting back on coffee, meditate
                more, or make their bedroom darker, when chronic insomnia is
                often rooted in deeper, psychological issues (e.g., financial
                anxiety, workplace stress…etc.). In fact, “<i
                  >present research [now] supports the view that sleep is
                  causally related to mental health difficulties</i
                >” (Sleep Medicine Reviews, Dec 2021, doi:
                10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101556). This matches up with what we
                observe—over 50% of our users reported that they have been
                diagnosed with depression, anxiety or other mental health
                conditions. Stellar Sleep uses psychology to help chronic
                insomniacs get their lives back.
              </p>
              <p>
                We start by understanding a person’s immediate sleep-related
                challenges and providing them with practical strategies for
                dealing with them. Then, we drill down on the underlying
                psychological drivers of a person’s chronic insomnia and create
                a program to resolve those drivers one by one. Participants
                spend 5-10 minutes per day completing modules in the Stellar
                Sleep app.
              </p>
              <p>
                We launched last August, and have already helped over 10,000
                patients improve their sleep permanently. Here’s how one of our
                customers, Victoria, describes her experience:
              </p>
              <p>
                “<i
                  >I’ve had insomnia for about 5 years. I was at the point of
                  desperation, willing to try anything. Insomnia feels very
                  lonely. It’s 2am and your spouse is asleep. You’re very alone
                  with your anxious thoughts. About the mortgage rates changing.
                  About all the things you have to do tomorrow without any
                  sleep. It feels like you’re trapped and alone.
                  <p>
                    After starting Stellar Sleep I’ve now started sleeping
                    better for the first time in 5 years. I’ve gotten hope back
                    that I can be normal. Most people who sleep well don’t worry
                    about sleep. A good night’s sleep should just be normal.
                  </p></i
                >”
              </p>
              <p>
                We have strong clinical data showing that we're just as
                effective as in-person treatment and have a year-long clinical
                study running with Harvard Medical School / Brigham &amp;
                Women’s Hospital paid for by the State of Massachusetts and the
                US Department of Commerce. On average, our users sleep 74
                minutes longer than before and spend 52% less time awake in the
                middle of the night.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have trouble with sleep, try our app and let us know what
                you think! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask
                and we will be happy to answer them. We look forward to hearing
                your comments and experiences!

                - it had to be global. - it had to be beautiful (in my eyes, at
                least). - it had to be technology and stats driven.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided I would try to list the full name and date of birth of
                all humans alive. While some may find the concept pointless, I
                immediately knew I had struck gold:
              </p>
              <p>
                - it was global and incredibly hard. - it had an almost artistic
                quality to it, like an ever-changing installation. - as a
                libertarian, I resent that states conduct censuses and then sit
                on the data. - One billion people in the world aren't officially
                registered. At least someone would acknowledge their existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created a non-profit called The Population Project. I would
                never make a dime off it, but at least my costs would be
                tax-deductible.
              </p>
              <p>
                I then started researching lists of names online. I quickly
                adopted two principles. First I would collect a minimal set of
                information : full name, birth date, and birth place. Second, I
                would only scrape public information, i.e. nothing behind a
                password.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a few months, I realized I needed help from more
                experienced developers. I chose to work on 4D, a platform I had
                used in the past to develop my company's information system. It
                was a tough choice: 4D is not a leading player in the back-end
                world, but I figured the growth of API tooling would make
                language choice less critical.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first iteration of our database was frustrating - way too
                slow to publish a website. I learned the power of incremental
                change, with each marginal improvement saving you a few percent
                of speed or space. I also got to implement concepts I had heard
                about but never implemented, such as mirroring, partitioning, or
                hash-indexing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I hired a team of six data processors in Madagascar who
                clean up and process the lists found online. Lots of Python and
                Excel macros in their day-to-day. I have instilled in them an
                obsession with quality. A bad record will sit in our base
                forever. After trying dozens of softwares, we've settled on
                Adobe Acrobat and Octoparse.
              </p>
              <p>
                The final piece was the website. I lucked out in finding a
                strong team in Romania. They build with Next.js and deploy on
                Vercel. I gave them Wikipedia as the model to aim for. We/they
                haven't been able to match Wikipedia's simplicity. Our pages are
                too heavy. But I find the site user-friendly, pleasing to the
                eye and reasonably fast. We can and we will do better.
              </p>
              <p>
                A word about privacy. Some people complain that because it
                publishes names and DOBs, the Population Project infringes on
                their privacy. We obviously don't see it that way.
              </p>
              <p>
                - All our info is public. That DOB you find on the site is
                probably in the voter list of your state, a list that anyone can
                request or plainfully download. - The info we publish is
                minimal. Basically, we say that you exist. No one will find
                anything about your race, religion, sexual preferences, job or
                income. - We have adopted Wikipedia's privacy policy. We do not
                record your IP, unless you create or edit a record. - We're
                using Matomo for our Analytics. Great stuff. It's not free but
                they do not use your data like GA.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why am I telling you all this? From the beginning, I've
                envisioned a three-step process:
              </p>
              <p>
                1) Build the database and populate it with millions of Western
                profiles. 2) Launch the site, where anybody can create or edit
                records and share them with their family. 3) When we've reached
                critical mass (1B records?), start making deals with NGOs and
                governments, and venture into other alphabets.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have just completed step 1. Step 2 is daunting as hell. I
                have grown a business but I have never grown a website. While I
                am ready to spend a bit of money on PR or SEO, I am not
                delusional: to reach the level of success we have in mind, we
                need this thing to go (somewhat) viral.
              </p>
              <p>How do you do that?</p>
