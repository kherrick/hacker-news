              <p>
                Everything looked correct. OpenSSL 3 with the FIPS provider
                enabled. Ruby built against it. A simple pg connection worked.
              </p>
              <p>
                The app failed once ActiveRecord was involved. The error came
                from libpq. It turned out the pg gem had pulled in a prebuilt
                native dependency that was linked against different crypto. That
                path was always there. It just was not exercised until
                ActiveRecord hit it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Forcing a source build fixed the issue because the extension
                then linked against the OpenSSL in the image.
              </p>
              <p>
                The takeaway is that a FIPS base image does not mean your
                dependency graph respects the same boundary once native code is
                involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Curious how others have seen this play out in Ruby, Python
                wheels, Go with CGO, or Node native addons.

                Here is the release note from Ollama that made this possible:

              <p>Technically, what I do is pretty straightforward:</p>
              <p>- Detect which local models are available in Ollama.</p>
              <p>
                - When internet access is unavailable, the client automatically
                switches to Ollama-backed local models instead of remote ones.
              </p>

                In practice, the best-performing model so far has been
                qwen3-coder:30b. I also tested glm-4.7-flash, which was released
                very recently, but it struggles with reliably following
                tool-calling instructions, so it is not usable for this workflow
                yet.

              before they happen. Here's a video walkthrough:

              >.
              <p>
                Between us, we've spent years working on satellite operations at
                SpaceX, Blue Origin, and NASA. At SpaceX, we managed
                constellation health for Starlink. At Blue, we worked on
                next-gen test infra for New Glenn. At NASA, we dealt with deep
                space communications. The same problem kept coming up: by the
                time you notice a link is degrading, you've often already lost
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The core issue is that satellite RF links are affected by dozens
                of interacting variables. A satellite passes overhead, and you
                need to predict whether the link will hold for the next few
                minutes. That depends on: the orbital geometry (elevation angle
                changes constantly), tropospheric attenuation (humidity affects
                signal loss via ITU-R P.676), rain fade (calculated via ITU-R
                P.618 - rain rates in mm/hr translate directly to dB of loss at
                Ka-band and above), ionospheric scintillation (we track the KP
                index from magnetometer networks), and network congestion on top
                of all that.
              </p>
              <p>
                The traditional approach is reactive. Operators watch
                dashboards, and when SNR drops below a threshold, they manually
                reroute traffic or switch to a backup link. With 10,000
                satellites in orbit today and 70,000+ projected by 2030, this
                doesn't scale. Our system ingests telemetry at around 100,000
                messages per second from satellites, ground stations, weather
                radar, IoT humidity sensors, and space weather monitors. We run
                physics-based models in real-time - the full link budget
                equations, ITU atmospheric standards, orbital propagation - to
                compute what should be happening. Then we layer ML models on
                top, trained on billions of data points from actual multi-orbit
                operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ML piece is where it gets interesting. We use federated
                learning because constellation operators (understandably) don't
                want to share raw telemetry. Each constellation trains local
                models on their own data, and we aggregate only the high-level
                patterns. This gives us transfer learning across different orbit
                types and frequency bands - learnings from LEO Ka-band links
                help optimize MEO or GEO operations. We can predict most link
                failures 3-5 minutes out with &gt;90% accuracy, which gives
                enough time to reroute traffic before data loss. The system is
                fully containerized (Docker/Kubernetes) and deploys on-premise
                for air-gapped environments, on GovCloud (AWS GovCloud, Azure
                Government), or standard commercial clouds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now we're testing with defense and commercial partners.
                The dashboard shows real-time link health, forecasts at
                60/180/300 seconds out, and root cause analysis (is this rain
                fade? satellite setting below horizon? congestion?). We expose
                everything via API - telemetry ingestion, predictions, topology
                snapshots, even an LLM chat endpoint for natural language
                troubleshooting.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hard parts we're still working on: prediction accuracy
                degrades for longer time horizons (beyond 5 minutes gets dicey),
                we need more labeled failure data for rare edge cases, and the
                federated learning setup requires careful orchestration across
                different operators' security boundaries. We'd love feedback
                from anyone who's worked on satellite ops, RF link modeling, or
                time-series prediction at scale. What are we missing? What would
                make this actually useful in a production NOC environment?

                We're Sahil and Manu, two brothers who spent the last 2 years
                training text-to-video models from scratch. Today we're
                releasing them under Apache 2.0.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are 2B param models capable of generating 2-5 seconds of
                footage at either 360p or 720p. In terms of model size, the
                closest comparison is Alibaba's Wan 2.1 1.3B. From our testing,
                we get significantly better motion capture and aesthetics.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're not claiming to have reached the frontier. For us, this is
                a stepping stone towards SOTA - proof we can train these models
                end-to-end ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>Why train a model from scratch?</p>
              <p>
                We shipped our first model in January 2024 (pre-Sora) as a 180p,
                1-second GIF bot, bootstrapped off Stable Diffusion XL. Image
                VAEs don't understand temporal coherence, and without the
                original training data, you can't smoothly transition between
                image and video distributions. At some point you're better off
                starting over.
              </p>
              <p>
                For v2, we use T5 for text encoding, Wan 2.1 VAE for
                compression, and a DiT-variant backbone trained with flow
                matching. We built our own temporal VAE but Wan's was smaller
                with equivalent performance, so we used it to save on embedding
                costs. (We'll open-source our VAE shortly.)
              </p>
              <p>
                The bulk of development time went into building curation
                pipelines that actually work (e.g., hand-labeling aesthetic
                properties and fine-tuning VLMs to filter at scale).
              </p>
              <p>
                What works: Cartoon/animated styles, food and nature scenes,
                simple character motion. What doesn't: Complex physics, fast
                motion (e.g., gymnastics, dancing), consistent text.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why build this when Veo/Sora exist? Products are extensions of
                the underlying model's capabilities. If users want a feature the
                model doesn't support (character consistency, camera controls,
                editing, style mapping, etc.), you're stuck. To build the
                product we want, we need to update the model itself. That means
                owning the development process. It's a bet that will take time
                (and a lot of GPU compute) to pay off, but we think it's the
                right one.
