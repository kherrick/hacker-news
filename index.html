                How it works: - Step 1: Define your product vision and MVP -
                Step 2: AI helps create technical architecture and data models -
                Step 3: Generate a staged development plan - Step 4: Create an
                AGENTS.md for automated workflows
              </p>
              <p>
                I've used AI coding tools for awhile. Before this workflow (and
                now, this tool), I kept getting "close but not quite" results
                from AI coding tools. I learned that the more context &amp;
                guidance I gave these tools up front, the better results I got.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other thing I have found with most tools that attempt to
                improve on "vibe coding" is that they add abstraction. To me,
                this just adds to the problem. AI coding agents are valuable,
                but they are error-prone - you need to be an active
                participation in their work. This workflow is designed to
                provide a scaffolding for these AI agents, while minimizing
                additional abstraction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love feedback on the workflow - especially curious if
                others find the upfront planning helpful or constraining.

                Real estate globally is still stuck in PDFs, local land offices,
                and offline processes. Tokenization exists, but almost all
                solutions jump straight into securities, fractionalization,
                investor pooling, and STOs, which triggers regulation and makes
                tokenization nearly impossible.
              </p>
              <p>RealDeed – Making Real Estate Digitally Alive</p>
              <p>
                We built RealDeed to enable every property owner and developer
                to tokenize real estate without selling or transferring title.
              </p>
              <p>The Core Question We Solved</p>
              <p>
                “Can I put my real estate on blockchain as a digital twin on
                metaverse without selling my house ownership?”
              </p>
              <p>Yes. That is exactly what RealDeed does.</p>
              <p>How RealDeed Works — Example</p>
              <p>
                Aryan owns a property in India while living in Dubai. The
                property is rented and the legal title remains fully with him,
                but the asset is not generating any additional value beyond
                rent.
              </p>
              <p>Using the RealDeed platform:</p>
              <p>
                His 32 sqm property is tokenized into a fixed model: 32 sqm ×
                10,000 = 320,000 utility tokens
              </p>
              <p>
                These tokens create a verified Digital Twin of the property.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Digital Twin is minted on blockchain and delivered to
                Aryan’s Web3 wallet on the XRP Ledger or EVM networks.
              </p>
              <p>He can:</p>
              <p>Transfer tokens to friends or clients globally</p>
              <p>
                List tokens on approved broker-dealer platforms (where
                permitted)
              </p>
              <p>
                Use tokens in compatible DeFi, fintech, or metaverse ecosystems
              </p>
              <p>
                All this without affecting title, ownership, possession, or
                rental rights.
              </p>
              <p>What RealDeed Actually Does</p>
              <p>RealDeed provides a seamless tokenization engine:</p>
              <p>1. Document Upload</p>
              <p>Owners/Developers upload:</p>
              <p>Title deed</p>
              <p>Floor plan</p>
              <p>DLD / RERA documents</p>
              <p>Valuation reports, if available</p>
              <p>2. Ownership Verification</p>
              <p>KYC of the owner</p>
              <p>Property verification</p>
              <p>Compliance screening</p>
              <p>3. Tokenization Model</p>
              <p>A standardized token model based on land area:</p>
              <p>32 sqm → 320,000 tokens</p>
              <p>120 sqm → 1,200,000 tokens</p>
              <p>These tokens represent digital utility.</p>
              <p>4. Blockchain Minting</p>
              <p>RealDeed mints the Digital Twin on:</p>
              <p>XRP Ledger</p>
              <p>EVM-compatible networks</p>
              <p>5. Token Delivery</p>
              <p>Tokens are delivered to the property owner’s Web3 wallet.</p>
              <p>6. Optional Integrations (Where Legally Allowed)</p>
              <p>Owners may connect their Digital Twins with:</p>
              <p>Broker-dealer platforms</p>
              <p>DeFi platforms</p>
              <p>Fintech apps</p>
              <p>Metaverse &amp; spatial computing systems</p>
              <p>Partner proptech solutions</p>
              <p>The RealDeed Advantage</p>
              <p>
                RealDeed creates the world’s first interoperable property layer
                on blockchain, where:
              </p>
              <p>A Dubai villa</p>
              <p>A Mumbai apartment</p>
              <p>A London flat</p>
              <p>
                …all exist as standardized digital twins, accessible across
                developer APIs, fintech integrations, and global digital
                ecosystems.
              </p>
              <p>This unlocks:</p>
              <p>Global property mapping</p>
              <p>Unified digital registries</p>
              <p>
                Digital twin transfers (e.g., gifting or selling tokens—not the
                property itself)
              </p>
              <p>
                Cross-border collaboration for developers and asset managers
              </p>
              <p>Metaverse-ready real estate representation</p>
              <p>
                For the first time, blockchains gain a structured way to
                understand property.

                I'm a news avoider, so I usually feel some smug
                self-satisfaction in those instances, but I wondered if there
                was a way to satisfy the urge to doomscroll without the anxiety.
              </p>
              <p>
                My hypothesis: Apply a 40-year latency buffer. You get the
                intellectual stimulation of "Big Events" without the fog of war,
                because you know the world didn't end.
              </p>
              <p>
                40 years creates a mirror between the Reagan Era and today. The
                parallels include celebrity populism, Cold War tensions (Soviets
                vs. Russia), and inflation economics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system ingests raw newspaper scans and uses a multi-step LLM
                pipeline to generate the daily edition:

              <p>OCR &amp; Ingestion: Converts raw pixels to text.</p>
              <p>
                Scoring: Grades events on metrics like Dramatic Irony and Name
                Recognition to surface stories that are interesting with
                hindsight. For example, a dry business blurb about Steve Jobs
                leaving Apple scores highly because the future context creates a
                narrative arc.
              </p>

                Objective Fact Extraction: Extracts a list of discrete,
                verifiable facts from the raw text.

              <p>
                Generation: Uses those extracted facts as the ground truth to
                write new headlines and story summaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                I expected a zen experience. Instead, I got an entertaining
                docudrama. Historical events are surprisingly compelling when
                serialized over weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, on Oct 7, 1985, Palestinian hijackers took over the
                cruise ship Achille Lauro. Reading this on a delay in 2025, the
                story unfolded over weeks: first they threw an American in a
                wheelchair overboard, then US fighter jets forced the escape
                plane to land, leading to a military standoff between US Navy
                SEALs and the Italian Air Force. Unbelievably, the US backed
                down, but the later diplomatic fallout led the Italian Prime
                Minister to resign.
              </p>
              <p>
                It hits the dopamine receptors of the news cycle, but with the
                comfort of a known outcome.

              <p>
                A year ago, I posted the first version. Since then, the app has
                matured significantly with two major updates:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Multi-platform Support: Now available on Mobile (iOS),
                Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux), and as a Self-hosted Docker
                image. (Android coming soon).
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Addons System: We added explicit support for extensions so
                you can hack around, vibe code your own integrations, and
                customize the app to fit your needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The core philosophy remains the same: Always private,
                transparent, and open source.
              </p>
