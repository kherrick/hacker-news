                We want to know: what kind of dev tools would make your
                Kubernetes development experience better? It can be a tool to
                simplify deployments, streamline cluster management, enhance
                scalability, or something completely innovative. All ideas are

              <p>
                I think like many people I find more work uninspiring, pointless
                and eroding. However, it's well paid, high status and hard to
                break into.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have an interview next week for a coffee engineer role which
                pays around a third of what I currently earn and would involve
                being on the road four out of five days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Has anyone else made a change like this? How did you find it?
                Did you miss the money and status?
              </p>
              <p>
                I know that office work is desirable for a reason (people like
                to sit down!!) but I think there might be something inspiring
                and rewarding about working with me hands. Am I being naïve
                because I've never really had to work with my hand?
              </p>
              <p>Thanks for your help and honest feedback.</p>

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I’m the founder of a SaaS platform called CommandBar. We’ve been
                mucking around with AI-related side quests for a while, but
                recently got excited enough about one to test it with some
                customers. Results were surprisingly good so we decided to
                launch it.
              </p>
              <p>
                HelpHub is AI chat + semantic search for any website or web app.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can add source content in 3 ways: -Crawling any public site
                via a URL (e.g. your marketing site or blog) -Syncing with a CMS
                (like Zendesk or Intercom) -Add content manually
              </p>
              <p>
                The chatbot is then “trained” on that content and will answer
                question’s based on that content only, not referencing directly
                the knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                The output is an embeddable widget the contains two things: the
                chatbot interface for user’s to ask questions, and a search
                interface for users to search through the content the bot is
                trained on directly (as well as view source content).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can play around with a demo on some popular sites here:
                <a href="https://helphub.commandbar.com"
                  >https://helphub.commandbar.com</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Some features we added that make it better IMO than just chat:
                -Suggested questions (based on the page the user is on and their
                chat history) -Suggested follow-up questions in a chat response
                -Ask a question about a specific doc -Recommend content based on
                who the user is and where they are
              </p>
              <p>
                Would love to hear feedback (not lost on me that there are other
                chatgpt-for-your-site products and we are probably missing a ton
                of functionality from there) and can also share details about
                how we built this. It’s not rocket science but does feel magic
                :)

              for a demo of sending and signing a contract.
              <p>
                I (Jake) was a co-founder of two B2B SaaS companies, RJMetrics
                (where Ben and I met), and Stitch. Everything about contracts
                was frustrating, both at those startups and the larger companies
                that acquired us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Way too often, the contracting process with a customer got
                adversarial—arguing over whose template to use, emailing Word
                docs back and forth, huge legal fees, and unpredictable delays
                that made it hard to know if a deal would ever close. Then, when
                we finally got the customer to sign, we had to keep track of all
                of the promises embedded in the contract. This is difficult when
                you have hundreds of customers and contract PDFs full of
                unstructured text.
              </p>
              <p>
                The breaking point came when one of our customers was acquired
                by Oracle. They wanted to keep using our product, but had to
                move from our original contract to the one that Oracle uses. In
                exchange for this, they were willing to increase the price they
                were paying from $6,000 to $24,000 per year.
              </p>
              <p>
                It took us 9 months to get the new contract in place, just to
                enable them to keep using the product. We spent more on
                attorneys than we gained from the upsell. And there was
                basically nothing we could do to improve that process as a
                single company operating in a system where standards don’t
                exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Contrast that to the standardization that the SAFE, or Simple
                Agreement for Future Equity, brought to seed investments, and
                the potential is obvious. (Past discussion of the SAFE at
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33639191"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33639191</a
                >)
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re a startup raising money on a SAFE, the process is
                simple, whether you’re raising $10k from an angel or $1M from a
                VC. Everyone already uses, or at least is familiar with, the
                same basic contract. There are a few variables that change on a
                deal-by-deal basis, but the transactions are vastly more
                efficient because everyone is on the same standard contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you start with standard contracts, you can build very
                different software to manage them compared to traditional
                contracts. Our business model is to provide the standard
                contracts for free and charge money from companies who use our
                software to sell to their customers (more on this below).
              </p>
              <p>
                The standard contracts we create are all related to buying and
                selling B2B software. This includes a non-disclosure agreement,

              <p>
                The process for creating and revising the contracts is modeled
                after an open-source software project, and they are released for
                free (as in both speech and beer) under the Creative Commons CC
                BY 4.0 license.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a committee of 40+ attorneys from tech companies and law
                firms who are analogous to code contributors (<a
                  href="https://commonpaper.com/committee"
                  >https://commonpaper.com/committee</a
                >). An attorney on our team, who you can think about like a
                maintainer, collects all of their feedback and synthesizes it
                into a version for release (eg the Design Partner Agreement
                v1.0). We post the agreements as DOCX, PDF, and HTML on our
                website and host markdown on Github.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the usage of the agreements happens outside of our
                platform, and we don’t have any visibility into that unless
                people choose to tell us. However, we do know that thousands of
                companies have signed the agreements, and millions of dollars
                worth of deals have been closed on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each agreement is split into two sections: the standard terms,
                which are the same across all instances, and a cover page, with
                variables that can be customized for a particular company and
                deal. The latter is basically a schema for each agreement type,
                and that leads to the fundamental trade-off in how we build our
                software. We have less flexibility around types of contracts
                (because we’re focused on the standard agreements, not arbitrary
                DOCX files), but in exchange, every agreement type has a
                consistent data model, which means that we can build
                integrations and features that work across all customers. This
                gain is huge.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, we can use the data in the fees section of our
                standard Cloud Service Agreement to automatically generate
                invoices and subscriptions using Stripe. Similarly, it’s trivial
                to use our API (<a href="https://api.commonpaper.com/docs"
                  >https://api.commonpaper.com/docs</a
                >) to check if an active NDA is in place before sharing
                confidential information or to keep a spreadsheet up to date
                with the SLA obligations for different customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional contract management tools are built around adding
                electronic signatures to documents full of unstructured text
                and/or creating a custom data model from a particular company’s
                bespoke contract. There’s no way they can offer features like
                this without a custom project for each particular contract. It’s
                basically the difference between custom software and a software
                product.
              </p>
              <p>
                Part of our feature set overlaps with the traditional tools. We
                can do things like send a contract to the other side, propose
                changes, approve, and sign. But our negotiation model is
                different in that it encourages both sides to keep changes
                narrowly scoped to the variables in the cover page. That makes
                it faster both to propose the changes and for each side to
                understand, and accept or reject, the changes proposed by their
                counterparty.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that, just as with SAFEs in the investment world, the
                potential efficiency gains and positive side effects of this
                model are so big that the transition is inevitable. We’d love
                for you all to try it out and let us know your feedback and
                suggestions. The agreements are free forever, and our software
                is free as well until you use it to close deals with 5
                customers.

                We’re interested to hear about any experiences you’ve had with
                contracts and how you’ve worked with them. We look forward to
                your comments!
