              <p>
                Between us, we've spent years working on satellite operations at
                SpaceX, Blue Origin, and NASA. At SpaceX, we managed
                constellation health for Starlink. At Blue, we worked on
                next-gen test infra for New Glenn. At NASA, we dealt with deep
                space communications. The same problem kept coming up: by the
                time you notice a link is degrading, you've often already lost
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The core issue is that satellite RF links are affected by dozens
                of interacting variables. A satellite passes overhead, and you
                need to predict whether the link will hold for the next few
                minutes. That depends on: the orbital geometry (elevation angle
                changes constantly), tropospheric attenuation (humidity affects
                signal loss via ITU-R P.676), rain fade (calculated via ITU-R
                P.618 - rain rates in mm/hr translate directly to dB of loss at
                Ka-band and above), ionospheric scintillation (we track the KP
                index from magnetometer networks), and network congestion on top
                of all that.
              </p>
              <p>
                The traditional approach is reactive. Operators watch
                dashboards, and when SNR drops below a threshold, they manually
                reroute traffic or switch to a backup link. With 10,000
                satellites in orbit today and 70,000+ projected by 2030, this
                doesn't scale. Our system ingests telemetry at around 100,000
                messages per second from satellites, ground stations, weather
                radar, IoT humidity sensors, and space weather monitors. We run
                physics-based models in real-time - the full link budget
                equations, ITU atmospheric standards, orbital propagation - to
                compute what should be happening. Then we layer ML models on
                top, trained on billions of data points from actual multi-orbit
                operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ML piece is where it gets interesting. We use federated
                learning because constellation operators (understandably) don't
                want to share raw telemetry. Each constellation trains local
                models on their own data, and we aggregate only the high-level
                patterns. This gives us transfer learning across different orbit
                types and frequency bands - learnings from LEO Ka-band links
                help optimize MEO or GEO operations. We can predict most link
                failures 3-5 minutes out with &gt;90% accuracy, which gives
                enough time to reroute traffic before data loss. The system is
                fully containerized (Docker/Kubernetes) and deploys on-premise
                for air-gapped environments, on GovCloud (AWS GovCloud, Azure
                Government), or standard commercial clouds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now we're testing with defense and commercial partners.
                The dashboard shows real-time link health, forecasts at
                60/180/300 seconds out, and root cause analysis (is this rain
                fade? satellite setting below horizon? congestion?). We expose
                everything via API - telemetry ingestion, predictions, topology
                snapshots, even an LLM chat endpoint for natural language
                troubleshooting.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hard parts we're still working on: prediction accuracy
                degrades for longer time horizons (beyond 5 minutes gets dicey),
                we need more labeled failure data for rare edge cases, and the
                federated learning setup requires careful orchestration across
                different operators' security boundaries. We'd love feedback
                from anyone who's worked on satellite ops, RF link modeling, or
                time-series prediction at scale. What are we missing? What would
                make this actually useful in a production NOC environment?

              <p>
                The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or
                BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your
                company/sensitive data stays on your machine!
              </p>
              <p>
                Today we're launching filesystem access... just like Claude
                Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell
                commands! But honestly, we didn't plan for this. It turns out
                the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally
                positioned us for this moment.
              </p>
              <p>--- The architectural bet we made 9 months ago</p>
              <p>
                Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where
                the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our
                agent entirely on your machine (client side).
              </p>
              <p>But building everything on the client side wasn't smooth.</p>
              <p>
                We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But
                we kept hitting walls:
              </p>
              <p>
                1) JS service worker is single-threaded, so we couldn't start
                multiple agents in parallel.
              </p>
              <p>
                2) Not having access to a NodeJS-like runtime meant we couldn't
                use many great npm packages (Vercel AI SDK, etc)
              </p>
              <p>
                So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away
                everything we built and start from scratch.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone
                binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use
                gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat
                adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK
                format. You can look at our entire codebase here:
                <a href="https://git.new/browseros-agent"
                  >https://git.new/browseros-agent</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>--- How we gave browser access to filesystem</p>
              <p>
                When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because
                Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there's no
                good way for their agent to access your files without uploading
                them to the server first.
              </p>
              <p>
                But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant
                just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent
                can now read and write files just like Claude Code.

              </p>
              <p>
                b) Open top 5 HN links, extract the details and write summary
                into a HTML file

                --- Where we are now If you haven't tried us since the last Show
                HN, give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of
                new features, and we've grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+
                downloads:

              <p>
                c) You can now build more reliable workflows using n8n-like
                graph

              <p>
                d) You can also use BrowserOS as an MCP server in Cursor or

              <p>--- Why we think browser is the right platform</p>
              <p>
                We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a
                Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app
                by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research,
                etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork,
                they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension.
                But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated
                features that wouldn't be possible otherwise. One example:
                Browser ACLs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we're adding
                browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): "role(agent):
                can never click buy" or "role(agent): read-only access on my
                bank's homepage." We have a prototype already—curious to hear
                your take on this and the overall thesis.
              </p>
              <p>We’ll be in the comments. Thanks for reading!</p>

                This is the first full-text example as far as I know (Gen Z
                bible doesn't count).

                There are hallucinations and issues, but the overall quality
                surprised me.

                LLMs have a lot of promise translating and rendering
                'accessible' more ancient texts.

                The technology has a lot of benefit for the faithful, that I

              <p>
                Next-edit autocomplete differs from standard autocomplete by
                using your recent edits as context when predicting completions.
                The model is small enough to run locally while outperforming
                models 4x its size on both speed and accuracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We tested against Mercury (Inception), Zeta (Zed), and Instinct
                (Continue) across five benchmarks: next-edit above/below cursor,
                tab-to-jump for distant changes, standard FIM, and noisiness. We
                found exact-match accuracy correlates best with real usability
                because code is fairly precise and the solution space is small.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prompt format turned out to matter more than we expected. We ran
                a genetic algorithm over 30+ diff formats and found simple
                `original`/`updated` blocks beat unified diffs. The verbose
                format is just easier for smaller models to understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Training was SFT on ~100k examples from permissively-licensed
                repos (4hrs on 8xH100), then RL for 2000 steps with tree-sitter
                parse checking and size regularization. The RL step fixes edge
                cases SFT can’t like, generating code that doesn’t parse or
                overly verbose outputs.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're open-sourcing the weights so the community can build fast,
                privacy-preserving autocomplete for any editor. If you're
                building for VSCode, Neovim, or something else, we'd love to see
                what you make with it!

                She learned so much faster through hands-on exploration than
                through books or videos. That's when I realized: what if I could
                recreate these physical experiments as interactive simulations?

                Lumen is the result - an interactive physics playground covering
                sound, light, motion, life, and mechanics. Each module lets you
                manipulate variables in real-time and see/hear the results
                immediately.
