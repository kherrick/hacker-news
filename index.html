                it worked, but was hard to tell what agents were doing, why
                something failed, or whether a workflow was actually
                progressing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We thought it would be more interesting to treat agents as
                long-lived workers with state and responsibilities and explicit
                handoffs. Something you can actually see and reason about,
                instead of just tailing logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we built Clawe, a small coordination layer on top of OpenClaw
                that lets agent workflows run, pause, retry, and hand control
                back to a human at specific points.
              </p>
              <p>
                This started as an experiment in how agent systems might feel to
                operate, but we're starting to see real potential for it,
                especially for content review and maintenance workflows in
                marketing. Curious what abstractions make sense, what feels
                unnecessary, and what breaks first.

                We've been building Tambo for about a year, and just released
                our 1.0.
              </p>
              <p>
                We make are making it easier to register React components with
                Zod schemas, a build an agent picks the right one and renders
                the right props.
              </p>
              <p>
                We handle many of the complications with building generative
                user interfaces like: managing state between the user, the
                agent, and react component, rendering partial props, and we
                handle auth between your user, and MCP. We also support adding
                MCP servers and most of the spec.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are 100% open-source and currently have 8k+ GitHub stars,
                thousands of developers, and over half-millions messages
                processed by our hosted service.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're building AI agents with generative UI, we'd like to
                hear from you.

              <p>
                One thing that’s always bothered me is that almost all
                conversational systems still reduce everything to transcripts,
                and throw away a ton of signals that need to be used downstream.
                Some existing emotion understanding models try to analyze and
                classify into small sets of arbitrary boxes, but they either
                aren’t fast / rich enough to do this with conviction in
                real-time.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I built a multimodal perception system which gives us a way
                to encode visual and audio conversational signals and have them
                translated into natural language by aligning a small LLM on
                these signals, such that the agent can "see" and "hear" you, and
                that you can interface with it via an OpenAI compatible tool
                schema in a live conversation.
              </p>
              <p>
                It outputs short natural language descriptions of what’s going
                on in the interaction - things like uncertainty building,
                sarcasm, disengagement, or even shift in attention of a single
                turn in a convo.
              </p>
              <p>Some quick specs:</p>
              <p>- Runs in real-time per conversation</p>
              <p>
                - Processing at ~15fps video + overlapping audio alongside the
                conversation
              </p>
              <p>- Handles nuanced emotions, whispers vs shouts</p>
              <p>- Trained on synthetic + internal convo data</p>
              <p>

              <a href="https://livedocs.com">https://livedocs.com</a>). We're
              building an AI-native data workspace that lets teams ask questions
              of their real data and have the system plan, execute, and maintain
              the analysis end-to-end.
              <p>
                We previously posted about LiveDocs four years ago (<a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30735058"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30735058</a
                >). Back then, LiveDocs was a no-code analytics tool for
                stitching together metrics from tools like Stripe and Google
                Analytics. It worked for basic reporting, but over time we ran
                into the same ceiling our users did. Dashboards are fine until
                the questions get messy, and notebooks slowly turn into
                hard-to-maintain piles of glue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the last few years, we rebuilt LiveDocs almost entirely
                around a different idea. Data work should behave like a living
                system, not a static document or a chat transcript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, LiveDocs is a reactive notebook environment backed by
                real execution engines. Notebooks are not linear. Each cell
                participates in a dependency graph, so when data or logic
                changes, only the affected parts recompute. You can freely mix
                SQL, Python, charts, tables, and text in the same document and
                everything stays in sync. Locally we run on DuckDB and Polars,
                and when you connect a warehouse like Snowflake, BigQuery, or
                Postgres, queries are pushed down instead of copying data out.
                Every result is inspectable and reproducible.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of this environment sits an AI agent, but it is not "chat
                with your data." The agent works inside the notebook itself. It
                can plan multi-step analyses, write and debug SQL or Python,
                spawn specialized sub-agents for different tasks, run code in a
                terminal, and browse documentation or the web when it lacks
                context. Because it operates inside the same execution graph as
                humans, you can see exactly what it ran, edit it, or take over
                at any point.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also support a canvas mode where the agent can build custom
                UI for your analysis, not just charts. This includes tables with
                controls, comparisons, and derived views that stay wired to the
                underlying data. When a notebook is not the right interface, you
                can publish parts of it as an interactive app. These behave more
                like lightweight internal tools, similar in spirit to Retool,
                but backed by the same analysis logic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything in LiveDocs is fully real-time collaborative.
                Multiple people can edit the same notebook, see results update
                live, comment inline, and share documents or apps without
                exposing raw code unless they want to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Teams use LiveDocs to investigate questions that do not fit
                cleanly into dashboards, build analyses that evolve over time
                without constant rewrites, and automate recurring questions
                without turning them into brittle pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pricing is pay-as-you-go, starting at $15 per month, with a free
                tier so people can try it without talking to us. You'll have to
                sign up, as it requires us to provision a sandbox for your to
                run your notebook. Here's a video demo:

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                We are still learning where this breaks. Long-running agent
                workflows on production data surface a lot of sharp edges. We
                would love feedback from people who have built or lived with
                analytics systems, notebooks, or "chat with your data" tools and
                felt their limits. Happy to go deep on technical details and
                trade notes.

                Here's a demo video:

              </p>
              <p>
                Why is this useful? (1) You don't have to figure out which
                webhooks you need or write listeners for each one. The library
                handles all of that. This follows the approach of libraries like
                dj-stripe in the Django world (<a href="https://dj-stripe.dev/"
                  >https://dj-stripe.dev/</a
                >). (2) Stripe's API has a 100 rpm rate limit. If you're
                checking subscription status frequently or building internal
                tools, you'll hit it. Querying your own Postgres doesn't have
                this problem. (3) You can give an AI agent read access to the
                stripe.* schema to debug payment issues—failed charges, refunds,
                whatever—without handing over Stripe dashboard access. (4) You
                can join Stripe data with your own tables for custom analytics,
                LTV calculations, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                It creates a webhook endpoint in your Stripe account to forward
                webhooks to your backend where a webhook listener stores all the
                data into a new <i>stripe.*</i> schema. You define your plans in
                TypeScript, run a sync command, and the library takes care of
                creating Stripe products and prices, handling webhooks, and
                keeping your database in sync. We also let you backfill your
                Stripe data for existing accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                It supports pre-paid usage credits, account wallets and
                usage-based billing. It also lets you generate a pricing table
                component that you can customize. You can access the user
                information using the simple API the library provides:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  billing.subscriptions.get({ userId });
  billing.credits.consume({ userId, key: "api_calls", amount: 1 });
  billing.usage.record({ userId, key: "ai_model_tokens_input", amount: 4726 });
</code></pre>
              Effectively, you don't have to deal with either the Stripe
              dashboard or the Stripe API/SDK any more if you don't want to. The
              library gives you a nice abstraction on top of Stripe that should
              cover ~most subscription payment use-cases.
              <p>
                Let's see how it works with a quick example. Say you have a
                billing plan like Cursor (the IDE) used to have: $20/mo, you get
                500 API completions + 2000 tab completions, you can buy
                additional API credits, and any additional usage is billed as
                overage.
              </p>
              <p>You define your plan in TypeScript:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  {
    name: "Pro",
    description: "Cursor Pro plan",
    price: [{ amount: 2000, currency: "usd", interval: "month" }],
    features: {
      api_completion: {
        pricePerCredit: 1,              // 1 cent per unit
        trackUsage: true,               // Enable usage billing
        credits: { allocation: 500 },
        displayName: "API Completions",
      },
      tab_completion: {
        credits: { allocation: 2000 },
        displayName: "Tab Completions",
      },
    },
  }
</code></pre>
              Then on the CLI, you run the `init` command which creates the DB
              tables + some API handlers. Run `sync` to sync the plans to your
              Stripe account and create a webhook endpoint. When a subscription
              is created, the library automatically grants the 500 API
              completion credits and 2000 tab completion credits to the user.
              Renewals and up/downgrades are handled sanely.
              <p>Consume code would look like this:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  await billing.credits.consume({
    userId: user.id,
    key: "api_completion",
    amount: 1,
  });
</code></pre>
              And if they want to allow manual top-ups by the user:
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  await billing.credits.topUp({
    userId: user.id,
    key: "api_completion",
    amount: 500,     // buy 500 credits, charges $5.00
  });
</code></pre>
              Similarly, we have APIs for wallets and usage.
              <p>
                This would be a lot of work to implement by yourself on top of
                Stripe. You need to keep track of all of these entitlements in
                your own DB and deal with renewals, expiry, ad-hoc grants, etc.
                It's definitely doable, especially with AI coding, but you'll
                probably end up building something fragile and hard to maintain.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is just a high-level overview of what the library is
                capable of. It also supports seat-level credits, monetary
                wallets (with micro-cent precision), auto top-ups, robust
                failure recovery, tax collection, invoices, and an
                out-of-the-box pricing table.
              </p>
              <p>
                I vibe-coded a little toy app for testing:
                <a href="https://snw-test.vercel.app"
                  >https://snw-test.vercel.app</a
                >. There's no validation so feel free to sign up with a dummy
                email, then subscribe to a plan with a test card: 4242 4242 4242
                4242, any future expiry, any 3-digit CVV.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                Feel free to try it out! If you end up using this library,
                please report any bugs on the repo. If you're having trouble /

                AI agents that can run tools on your machine are powerful for
                knowledge work, but they’re only as useful as the context they
                have. Rowboat is an open-source, local-first app that turns your
                work into a living knowledge graph (stored as plain Markdown
                with backlinks) and uses it to accomplish tasks on your
                computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, you can say "Build me a deck about our next quarter
                roadmap." Rowboat pulls priorities and commitments from your
                graph, loads a presentation skill, and exports a PDF.

              <p>Rowboat has two parts:</p>
              <p>
                (1) A living context graph: Rowboat connects to sources like
                Gmail and meeting notes like Granola and Fireflies, extracts
                decisions, commitments, deadlines, and relationships, and writes
                them locally as linked and editable Markdown files
                (Obsidian-style), organized around people, projects, and topics.
                As new conversations happen (including voice memos), related
                notes update automatically. If a deadline changes in a standup,
                it links back to the original commitment and updates it.
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) A local assistant: On top of that graph, Rowboat includes an
                agent with local shell access and MCP support, so it can use
                your existing context to actually do work on your machine. It
                can act on demand or run scheduled background tasks. Example:
                “Prep me for my meeting with John and create a short voice
                brief.” It pulls relevant context from your graph and can
                generate an audio note via an MCP tool like ElevenLabs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why not just search transcripts? Passing gigabytes of email,
                docs, and calls directly to an AI agent is slow and lossy. And
                search only answers the questions you think to ask. A system
                that accumulates context over time can track decisions,
                commitments, and relationships across conversations, and surface
                patterns you didn't know to look for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rowboat is Apache-2.0 licensed, works with any LLM (including
                local ones), and stores all data locally as Markdown you can
                read, edit, or delete at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our previous startup was acquired by Coinbase, where part of my
                work involved graph neural networks. We're excited to be working
                with graph-based systems again. Work memory feels like the
                missing layer for agents.

                It turned out things get messy when your software is running in
                places you can't simply SSH into.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the last year, we’ve also helped modernize a lot of
                home-baked solutions: bash scripts that email when updates fail,
                Excel sheets nobody trusts to track customer versions, engineers
                driving to customer sites to fix things in person, debug
                sessions over email (“can you take a screenshot of the logs and
                send it to me?”), customers with access to internal AWS or GCP
                registries because there was no better option, and deployments
                two major versions behind that nobody wants to touch.
              </p>
              <p>
                We waited a year before making our first breaking change, which
                led to a major SemVer update—but it was eventually necessary. We
                needed to completely rewrite how we manage customer
                organizations. In Distr, we differentiate between vendors and
                customers. A vendor is typically the author of a software / AI
                application that wants to distribute it to customers.
                Previously, we had taken a shortcut where every customer was
                just a single user who owned a deployment. We’ve now introduced
                customer organizations. Vendors onboard customer organizations
                onto the platform, and customers own their internal user
                management, including RBAC. This change obviously broke our API,
                and although the migration for our cloud customers was smooth,
                custom solutions built on top of our APIs needed updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other notable features we’ve implemented since our first launch:
              </p>
              <p>
                - An OCI container registry built on an adapted version of
                <a href="https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/"
                  >https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/</a
                >, directly embedded into our codebase and served via a separate
                port from a single Docker image. This allows vendors to
                distribute Docker images and other OCI artifacts if customers
                want to self-manage deployments.
              </p>
              <p>
                - License Management to restrict which customers can access
                which applications or artifact versions. Although “license
                management” is a broadly used term, the main purpose here is to
                codify contractual agreements between vendors and customers. In
                its simplest form, this is time-based access to specific
                software versions, which vendors can now manage with Distr.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Container logs and metrics you can actually see without SSH
                access. Internally, we debated whether to use a time-series
                database or store all logs in Postgres. Although we had to
                tinker quite a bit with Postgres indexes, it now runs stably.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Secret Management, so database passwords don’t show up in
                configuration steps or logs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distr is now used by 200+ vendors, including Fortune 500
                companies, across on-prem, GovCloud, AWS, and GCP, spanning
                health tech, fintech, security, and AI companies. We’ve also
                started working on our first air-gapped environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Distr 3.0, we’re working on native Terraform / OpenTofu and
                Zarf support to provision and update infrastructure in
                customers’ cloud accounts and physical environments—empowering
                vendors to offer BYOC and air-gapped use cases, all from a
                single platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distr is fully open source and self-hostable:

                As an experiment, we gave Claude Code the OOXML spec, a concrete
                editor architecture, and a Playwright-based test suite. The
                agent iterated in a (Ralph) loop over a few nights and produced
                a working editor from scratch.

                Core text editing works today. Tables and images are functional

              <p>
                I built ArtisanForge, a free platform to learn PHP and Laravel
                through a medieval-fantasy RPG. Instead of traditional
                tutorials, you progress through kingdoms, solve coding exercises
                in a browser editor, earn XP, join guilds, and fight boss
                battles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tech stack: Laravel 12, Livewire 3, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js.
                Code execution runs sandboxed via php-wasm in the browser.
              </p>
              <p>What's in there:</p>
              <p>- 12 courses across 11 kingdoms (PHP basics to deployment)</p>
              <p>
                - 100+ interactive exercises with real-time code validation
                using AST analysis
              </p>
              <p>
                - AI companion (Pip the Owlox) that uses Socratic method – never
                gives direct answers
              </p>
              <p>
                - Full gamification: XP, levels, streaks, achievements, guilds,
                leaderboard
              </p>
              <p>- Multilingual (EN/FR/NL)</p>
              <p>
                The idea came from seeing too many beginners drop off
                traditional courses. Wrapping concepts in quests and progression
                mechanics keeps motivation high without dumbing down the
                content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything is free, no paywall, no premium tier. Feedback
                welcome – especially from Laravel devs and educators.
