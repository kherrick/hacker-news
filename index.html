              <p>
                This time I decided to make it in the theme of an evil Sith Lord
                that commands the Galactic Cookie Empire, because I found my
                previous cookie consent game a bit boring after a while.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's the website's welcome page and the cookie consent game:
                <a href="https://cookie.engineer/index.html"
                  >https://cookie.engineer/index.html</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                (the cookie consent game isn't started on any other page of my
                website, only on the welcome page)
              </p>
              <p>
                I also made a "making of" weblog article series, in case you're
                interested in the development process and how I implemented it
                and what kind of troubles I went through already:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Making of the Game:
                <a
                  href="https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website-part-1.html"

                >

              <p>
                - Making of the Avatar:
                <a
                  href="https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website-part-2.html"

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                - Debuggers to toy around with:

                  >https://cookie.engineer/design/consent/index.html</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                It "should" work on modern browsers. I tested it on Firefox on
                Linuxes, Chrome/Chromium on Linuxes, and Safari on Macbook.
                Don't have an iPhone so I can't test that, but my two old
                Android phones were also working fine with the meta viewport
                hack (I can't believe this is still the "modern" way to do
                things after 15 years. Wtf).
              </p>
              <p>
                Best experience is of course with a bigger display. On smaller
                screen sizes, the game will use a camera to zoom around the game
                world and follow the player's spaceship. Minimum window width is
                1280 pixels for no camera, and I think 800 pixels to be playable
                (otherwise the avatar gets in the way too much in the boss
                fights).
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh, there's also a secret boss fight that you can unlock when
                you toy around with the Dev Tools :)
              </p>
              <p>What's left to do on the avatar animation side:</p>
              <p>
                - I have to backport CMUdict to JavaScript / ECMAScript. That's
                what I'm working on right now, as I'm not yet satisfied with the
                timings of the phonemes. Existing tools and pipelines that do
                this in python aren't realtime, which leads to my next point.
              </p>
              <p>
                - I want to switch to using the "waveform energy detection" and
                a zero cross rate detector to time phonemes more correctly. I
                believe that changes in waveforms and their structures can
                detect differences in phonemes, but it's a gut feeling and not a
                scientific fact. Existing phoneme animation papers were kind of
                shit and broken (see my making of article 2). The phoneme
                boundary detector is highly experimental though and is gonna
                need a couple weeks more time until it's finished.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's it for now, hope you gonna enjoy your stay on my website
                and I hope you gonna have fun playing the Cookie Consent Game :)
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh, also, because it might not be obvious: No LLMs were used in
                the making of this website. Pretty much everything is
                hand-coded, and unbundled and unminified on purpose so visitors
                can learn from the code if they want to.

                Tidy Baby is a new game made by me and Wyna Liu (of NYT
                Connections!) that is inspired by the legendary card-based game
                SET that we assume many of you love (we too love SET).
              </p>
              <p>
                In SET, you’ve got four dimensions: shape, number, color, and
                shading, each with three variants.
              </p>
              <p>In Tidy Baby you only have to deal with three dimensions:</p>
              <p>
                - word length (3, 4, or 5 letters) - part of speech (noun, verb,
                or adjective) - style (bold, underline, or italic)
              </p>
              <p>
                Like in SET, you are trying to form sets of three cards where,
                along each dimension, the set is either all the same or all
                different. If you’ve never played SET there are more
                details/examples at “how to play” in the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mechanics of Tidy Baby are sort of inspired by a
                solitaire/practice version of SET I sometimes play where you
                draw two random cards and have to name the third card that would
                make a valid set.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Tidy Baby you are presented with two “game cards” and a grid
                of up to nine candidates to complete a valid set – your job is
                to pick the right one before the clock runs out.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike in SET, you get points for “partial” sets where your set
                is valid on one or two dimensions (but not all three). It’s
                actually a pretty fun challenge to try to get only sets that are
                invalid along all three dimensions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In building the game, we were sort of surprised that the biggest
                challenge was ensuring that all words were unambiguously one
                part of speech. You’d be surprised how hard it is to find
                three-letter adjectives that are not also common verbs or nouns.
                We did our best!
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve got three “paces” in the game: Steady, Strenuous, and
                Grueling (s/o MECC!)
