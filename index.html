                SO tell me, what if I build my business on this platform and it
                does this?! and guess what?! Noone to call, no phone number and
                when you click on the link that says Get Support it dumps you at
                some generic support portal with no instructions. Firebase is
                100% crap. I need to find an alternative to use with Flutter.

              <p>
                When building frontends with Javascript, the native localStorage
                API is super useful for keeping track of state between sessions
                in the same browser, but it's not as good a solution when your
                data needs to be shared across multiple devices or browsers.
              </p>
              <p>
                For instance, let's say you want to show a welcome modal to all
                new users that sign up for your product. If you use localStorage
                to track if a user has already seen this modal, your users will
                end up getting the experience repeatedly every time they switch
                devices or browsers, or whenever Chrome decides to nuke your
                data.

                I built remoteStorage to help fix that. Using the same API as
                localStorage, remoteStorage allows you to easily read and write
                data on the fly while maintaining state across browsers and
                devices in order to provide a better user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is built as a monorepo in Typescript and contains a
                JS library that works across any Javascript stack (including
                Node.js and React Native) and is lightweight (~1 kb minified).
                The server is built with Nest.js with a disk-persisted Redis
                Database. It can be deployed in a few minutes using Docker.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the biggest challenges when building this was coming up
                with a secure scheme for handling authentication while still
                keeping the API dead simple for frontend devs to use. While the
                project is intended to store non-sensitive data like impression
                events/preferences, I still wanted to make sure data couldn’t
                easily leak or be tampered with.
              </p>
              <p>
                One solution has been to generate a unique secret UUID per user
                on your own backend to identify the user. Alternatively, you
                could create a simple wrapper/proxy API around remoteStorage
                that uses your own authentication method to verify the user's
                identity before allowing them to access the data (this is super
                simple to build with React Server Components). Then, you could
                pick a secure and secret Instance ID that is not publicly
                available to ensure that only your application can access the
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Has anyone felt the same pain points with localStorage before?
                Is this solution useful? Let me know what you think or ideas for
                how I can improve it :)

                In marimo, a notebook’s code, outputs, and program state are
                always consistent. Run a cell and marimo reacts by automatically
                running the cells that reference its declared variables. Delete
                a cell and marimo scrubs its variables from program memory,
                eliminating hidden state. Our reactive runtime is based on
                static analysis, so it’s performant. If you’re worried about
                accidentally triggering expensive computations, you can disable
                specific cells from auto-running.
              </p>
              <p>
                marimo comes with UI elements like sliders, a dataframe
                transformer, and interactive plots that are automatically
                synchronized with Python [3]. Interact with an element and the
                cells that use it are automatically re-run with its latest
                value. Reactivity makes these UI elements more useful and
                ergonomic than Jupyter’s ipywidgets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every marimo notebook can be run as a script from the command
                line, with cells executed in a topologically sorted order, or
                served as an interactive web app, using the marimo CLI.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re a team of just two developers. We chose to develop marimo
                because we believe that the Python community deserves a better
                programming environment to do research and communicate it;
                experiment with code and share it; and learn computational
                science and teach it. We’ve seen lots of research start in
                Jupyter notebooks (much of my own has), only to fail to
                reproduce; lots of promising prototypes built that were never
                made real; and lots of tutorials written that failed to engage
                students.
              </p>
              <p>
                marimo has been developed with the close input of scientists and
                engineers, and with inspiration from many tools, including
                Pluto.jl and streamlit. We open-sourced it recently because we
                feel it’s ready for broader use. Please try it out (pip install
                marimo &amp;&amp; marimo tutorial intro). We’d appreciate your
                feedback!
