                Most LLM apps can be built by properly integrating LLMs with a
                knowledge base consisting of domain-specific or company-specific
                data. The scope of this knowledge base can change based on the
                task- it can be something as narrow and static as your API docs
                or as broad and fluid as meeting transcripts from your customer
                support calls.
              </p>

                To effectively use their data, most teams need to build a
                similar stack—datasource integrations, async embedding jobs,
                vector databases, bucket storage for non textual data, a way to
                version prompts, and potentially an additional database for the
                text data. Baseplate provides much of the backend for you
                through simple APIs, so you can focus on building your core
                product and less on building common infra.
              </p>
              <p>
                At my previous role at Google X, I worked on building data
                infrastructure for geospatial data pipelines and knowledge
                graphs. One of my projects was to integrate knowledge graph
                triples with LaMDA, and I discovered the need for LLM tooling
                after using one of Google's initial prompt chaining tools. Ani
                was a PM at Logitech, shipping products in their Computer Vision
                team, and at the same time building side projects with GPT-3.
              </p>
              <p>
                The core of Baseplate is our simplified multimodal database,
                which allows you to store text, embeddings, data, and metadata
                in one place. Through a spreadsheet-style interface, you can
                edit your vectors and metadata (which is surprisingly complex
                with existing tools), and add images that can be returned at
                query time. Users can choose between standard semantic search or
                hybrid search (weighted keywords/semantics for larger, more
                technical datasets). Hybrid search on Baseplate utilizes two
                open-source models that can be tuned for your use case
                (instructor &amp; SPLADE). Datasets are organized into
                documents, which you can keep in sync through our API or through
                the UI (this way you can keep your datasets fresh when ingesting
                data from Google Drive/Notion/ etc).
              </p>
              <p>
                After your datasets are set up, we have an App Builder where you
                can iterate on prompts with input variables, and create context
                variables that pull directly from a dataset at query time. We
                give you all the knobs and dials, so that you can configure
                exactly how your search is performed and how it is integrated
                with your prompt.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you're satisfied with an app configuration, you deploy it
                to an endpoint. All you need is a single API call and we'll pull
                from one (or multiple) datasets in your app and inject the text
                into the prompt. We also return all the search results in the
                API response, so you can build a custom UX around images or
                links in your dataset. Endpoints have built in utilities for
                human feedback and logging. With GPT-4 being able to take images
                as input, we will soon be working on a way to pipe images from
                your dataset directly to the model. And all of these tools are
                in a team workspace, where you can quickly iterate and build
                together.

              <a href="https://noya.io">https://noya.io</a>), a product design
              tool that lets everyone design like a designer. Here’s a video:
              <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910"
                >https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910</a
              >.
              <p>
                Getting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing
                tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too
                low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other
                hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced
                skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out
                a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to
                make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more
                designers is time-consuming and expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                David and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we
                realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their
                knowledge (e.g. design rules and components) into a tool, then
                let non-designers (PMs, marketing, engineers) use that tool to
                make new screens and features. This helps remove design as a
                bottleneck for a lot of product development. We built such tools
                at Airbnb, and with Noya we’re building them for product teams
                everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Current design tools are too freeform for non-designers to
                design great products. They let you do anything, like draw
                rectangles and move text blocks anywhere, so it's easy to mess
                things up, introduce inconsistencies, and so on. With Noya,
                designers set up "guardrails" in the form of a design system
                (rules and components for a company's design), then
                non-designers work within those constraints. This makes it
                harder to mess up and quicker to build something that fits in
                with your product. Footguns begone!
              </p>
              <p>
                It all starts with wireframing, i.e. drawing a minimal layout
                that shows the elements that would exist on the screen. Noya
                combines wireframes and design systems to generate high-fidelity
                designs and code. If you have an idea for a user interface, you
                can use Noya to quickly wireframe that idea by clicking and
                dragging to place blocks for each element of your user
                interface. For each block, choose a type and provide any content
                that goes inside it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the rules and component library of the design system
                you select, Noya automatically turns your wireframe into a
                high-fidelity design. This design can be exported to design
                files, to Figma or Sketch, or to React code.
              </p>
              <p>
                (If you’re curious what the React code looks like, try exporting
                and take a look! There’s plenty of room for improvement,
                especially around responsive layouts, but we think it’s a
                reasonable starting point. The code export is configurable on a
                per-design-system basis so that it’s closer to a company’s
                preferred standards).
              </p>
              <p>
                Most tools in this space are optimized for either low-fidelity
                wireframes that are quick to create (e.g. Balsamiq), or
                high-fidelity output that’s slow to create (e.g. Figma). We
                think there’s a gap in the market for a great wireframing tool
                that produces a high-fidelity output quickly. For example,
                two-thirds of Figma users are non-designers. While there are
                many valid reasons for a non-designer to use Figma, there’s
                often a lot of upfront effort required to learn the tool and set
                up components. We think there should be a lower-effort way for
                non-designers to create high-fidelity designs.

                Based on feedback from our Show HN (<a

                library, and added a documentation reference for each block
                type. The docs are interactive, so you can play with our editor

                Startup founders and PMs have used Noya to build landing pages,
                dashboards, and other flows of their apps. We have some
                templates on our site (<a href="https://noya.io/templates"
                  >https://noya.io/templates</a
                >) that give examples of what people commonly build in Noya. We
                use Noya ourselves, and have been surprised by how frustrating
                it was to go back to existing design tools after using even the
                earliest prototypes of Noya. Existing design tools just aren’t
                built for the comprehensive design systems that products are
                based on today.

                Noya currently supports one design system based on Chakra UI.
                We’re adding additional design systems soon, including Material
                Design, as well as the ability to import custom design systems.
                If your company has an open source design system and you’re
                interested in trying Noya with it, we may be able to integrate
                your design system for free. Get in touch if you’re interested -

                It's still in a very beta state (bugs and instability expected),
                but I felt like it was a good time to make it public since a lot
                of its core features are mostly presentable. I plan to continue
                working on it in my spare time to try and improve the usability
                of the code.
              </p>
              <p>Two main use cases I could see for it:</p>
              <p>1) People using it for educational purposes.</p>
              <p>
                2) People integrating it into other more general purpose engines
                that they're working on since Stratus is primarily a rendering
                engine. Any extensions to the rendering code that are made
                public would then further help others.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I think it will remain very niche but I'm hoping it will
                still be helpful for people in the future.

                Convoy is an open-source webhooks gateway. Webhooks continue to
                be hard at scale, and large teams require consistent tooling for
                inbound &amp; outbound webhooks. Convoy enables developers to
                securely send, receive and manage millions of webhooks reliably
                with features like retries, rate limiting, circuit breaking,
                customer-facing webhook logs, zero downtime secrets rotation and
                more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since our initial launch [0], we've learned a lot about our
                users and made several important improvements we are excited to
                share:
              </p>
              <p>
                - We are now a webhooks gateway! Akin to API Gateways that sit
                at the edge of your network to receive all API traffic and route
                them to the respective microservice, webhooks gateways sit at
                the edge of your network to receive webhooks from any backend
                service and route to client endpoints as well as ingest events
                from multiple providers and route them to the required backend
                services.
              </p>
              <p>
                - We now have first-class integration with Pub/Sub Systems. Our
                users wanted increased deliverability guarantees. Your backend
                services write events to a queue/topic etc. Convoy consumes the
                queues, creates webhook events and dispatches those reliably to
                client endpoints. We currently support Amazon SQS and Google
                PubSub. On our roadmap, we have the following planned - Kafka,
                RabbitMQ &amp; Nats (In that order)
              </p>
              <p>
                - We switched our backend store to PostgreSQL. This improves the
                self-hosted experience tremendously. MongoDB was great for
                storing schemaless data, but was severely lacking in some
                important features for our users, e.g. transactions don't work
                on a single node; you need to bootstrap a replica set; also, we
                wanted to ship updates frequently, but the lack of migrations
                for schema &amp; data changes slowed us down.
              </p>
              <p>
                - We decided to go the open-core route of OSS monetisation
                because it offered us a good balance to serve our community and
                make enough money to run the company. Like GitLab, we hope to be
                good stewards of our community edition. Since our enterprise
                edition is simply a wrapper around the community edition with
                enterprise features like RBAC, Audit Logs etc., we are properly
                incentivised to continue making it excellent.
              </p>
              <p>
