              <a href="https://poly.app">https://poly.app</a>). We’re building
              an app to replace Finder/File Explorer with something more
              intelligent and searchable. Think of it like Dropbox + NotebookLM
              + Perplexity for terabytes of your files. Here’s a quick demo:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsqCySU4Ln0"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsqCySU4Ln0</a
              >.
              <p>
                Poly can search your content in natural language, across a broad
                range of file types and down to the page, paragraph, pixel, or
                point in time. We also provide an integrated agent that can take
                actions on your files such as creating, editing, summarizing,
                and researching. Any action that you can take, the agent can
                also take, from renaming, moving, tagging, annotating, and
                organizing files for you. The agent can also read URLs, youtube
                links, and can search the web and even download files for you.

                To try it out, navigate to one of these public folders and use
                the agent or search to find things. The demo video above can
                give you an idea of how the UI roughly works. Select files by
                clicking on them. Quick view by pressing space. Open the details
                for any file by pressing cmd + i. You can search from the top
                middle bar (or press cmd + K), and all searches will use
                semantic similarity and search within the files. Or use the
                agent from the bottom right tools menu (or press cmd + ?) and
                you can ask about the files, have the agent search for you,
                summarize things, etc.

                We decided to build this after launching an early image-gen
                company back in March 2022, and realizing how painful it was for
                users to store, manage, and search their libraries, especially
                in a world of generative media. Despite our service having over
                150,000 users at that point, we realized that our true calling
                was fixing the file browser to make it intelligent, so we shut
                our service down in 2023 and pivoted to this.
              </p>
              <p>
                We think Poly will be a great fit for anyone that wants to do
                useful things with their files, such as summarizing research
                papers, finding the right media or asset, creating a shareable
                portfolio, searching for a particular form or document, and
                producing reports and overviews. Of course, it’s a great way to
                organize your genAI assets as well. Or just use it to organize
                notes, links, inspo, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, Poly is built on our advanced search model,
                Polyembed-v1 that natively supports multimodal search across
                text, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audio,
                video, PDFs, and more. We allow you to search by phrase, file
                similarity, color, face, and several other kinds of features.
                The agent is particularly skilled at using the search, so you
                can type in something like “find me the last lease agreement I
                signed” and it can go look for it by searching, reading the
                first few files, searching again if nothing matches, etc. But
                the quality of our embed model means it almost always finds the
                file in the first search.
              </p>
              <p>
                It works identically across web and desktop, except on desktop
                it syncs your cloud files to a folder (just like google drive).
                On the web we use clever caching to enable offline support and
                file conflict recovery. We’ve taken great pains to make our
                system faster than your existing file browser, even if you’re
                using it from a web browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                File storage plans are currently at: 100GB free tier, paid tier
                is 2TB at $10/m, and 1c per GB per month on top of the 2TB. We
                also have rate limits for agent use that vary at different
                tiers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re excited to expand with many features over the following
                months, including “virtual files” (store your google docs in
                Poly), sync from other hosting providers, mobile apps, an MCP
                ecosystem for the agent, access to web search and deep research
                modes, offline search, local file support (on desktop),
                third-party sources (WebDAV, NAS), and a whole lot more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our waitlist is now open and we’ll be letting folks in starting
                today! Sign up at

                We’d also love to hear your thoughts (and concerns) about what
                we’re building, as we’re early in this journey so your feedback
                can very much shape the future of our company!

              <p>
                We kept seeing the same problems in the OCSF (<a
                  href="https://ocsf.io"
                  >https://ocsf.io</a
                >) community: 1) Schemas change constantly. Large companies have
                whole teams dedicated to keeping vendor→OCSF mappings up to
                date. 2) There’s no shared library of mappings, so everyone
                recreates the same work. 3) Writing mappers is tedious,
                repetitive work. 4) Most pipelines use proprietary DSLs that are
                hard to share and hard for tools/LLMs to generate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tangent takes a different approach: no DSLs – mappings and
                enrichments are just normal code compiled to WASM, shareable
                plugins – we maintain a community library (<a
                  href="https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins"
                  >https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins</a
                >), interoperability – we can run other engines’ DSLs (e.g.,
                Bloblang) inside WASM for easy migration, full flexibility –
                plugins can validate schemas, call external APIs (<a
                  href="https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent/blob/main/examples/enrichment/main.go#L58"
                  >https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent/blob/main/examples/en...</a
                >), or perform complex transforms (<a

              We have plenty more examples in the repo.
              <p>
                Because plugins are just Go/Python/Rust, LLMs can create new
                mappers with ease. For example, I asked:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  Generate a mapper from AWS Security Hub Finding to OCSF
</code></pre>
              and only had to make a few minor tweaks. (<a

                Performance-wise, a 16-core Amazon Linux box processes ~480 MB/s
                end-to-end (TCP → Rust-WASM transform → sink) on ~100-byte JSON
                logs. The CLI includes tooling to scaffold, test, and benchmark
                plugins locally. Here's a deep dive into how we are able to get
                this performance:
