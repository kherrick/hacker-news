              <p>
                I'm a solo developer who's been doing UI/UX work since 2007.
                Over the years, I watched design tools evolve from lightweight
                products into bloated feature-heavy platforms. I kept finding
                myself using a small amount of the features while the rest just
                mostly got in the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                So a few years ago I set out to build a design tool just like I
                wanted. So I built Vecti with what I actually need:
                pixel-perfect grid snapping, a performant canvas renderer,
                shared asset libraries, and export/presentation features. No
                collaborative whiteboarding. No plugin ecosystem. No enterprise
                features. Just the design loop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Four years later, I can proudly show it off. Built and hosted in
                the EU with European privacy regulations. Free tier available
                (no credit card, one editor forever).
              </p>
              <p>
                On privacy: I use some basic analytics (page views, referrers)
                but zero tracking inside the app itself. No session recordings,
                no behavior analytics, no third-party scripts beyond the
                essentials.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're a solo designer or small team who wants a tool that
                stays out of your way, I'd genuinely appreciate your feedback:

                Happy to answer questions about the tech stack, architecture
                decisions, why certain features didn't make the cut, or what's
                next.

                I combined shamir secret sharing (hashicorp vault's
                implementation) with age-encryption, and packaged it using WASM
                for a neat in-browser offline UX.

                The idea is that if something happens to me, my friends and
                family would help me get back access to the data that matters
                most to me. 5 out of 7 friends need to agree for the vault to
                unlock.

                My friend and I have been experimenting with using LLMs to
                reason about biotech stocks. Unlike many other sectors, Biotech
                trading is largely event-driven: FDA decisions, clinical trial
                readouts, safety updates, or changes in trial design can cause a
                stock to 3x in a single day (<a
                  href="https://www.biotradingarena.com/cases/MDGL_2023-12-14_Resmetirom_NASH"
                  >https://www.biotradingarena.com/cases/MDGL_2023-12-14_Resmet...</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Interpreting these ‘catalysts,’ which comes in the form of a
                press release, usually requires analysts with previous expertise
                in biology or medicine. A catalyst that sounds “positive” can
                still lead to a selloff if, for example: the effect size is
                weaker than expected
              </p>
              <p>- results apply only to a narrow subgroup</p>
              <p>- endpoints don’t meaningfully de-risk later phases,</p>
              <p>- the readout doesn’t materially change approval odds.</p>
              <p>
                To explore this, we built BioTradingArena, a benchmark for
                evaluating how well LLMs can interpret biotech catalysts and
                predict stock reactions. Given only the catalyst and the
                information available before the date of the press release
                (trial design, prior data, PubMed articles, and market
                expectations), the benchmark tests to see how accurate the model
                is at predicting the stock movement for when the catalyst is
                released.
              </p>
              <p>
                The benchmark currently includes 317 historical catalysts. We
                also created subsets for specific indications (with the largest
                in Oncology) as different indications often have different
                patterns. We plan to add more catalysts to the public dataset
                over the next few weeks. The dataset spans companies of
                different sizes and creates an adjusted score, since large-cap
                biotech tends to exhibit much lower volatility than small and
                mid-cap names.
              </p>
              <p>Each row of data includes:</p>
              <p>
                - Real historical biotech catalysts (Phase 1–3 readouts, FDA
                actions, etc.) and pricing data from the day before, and the day
                of the catalyst
              </p>
              <p>- Linked Clinical Trial data, and PubMed pdfs</p>
              <p>
                Note, there are may exist some fairly obvious problems with our
                approach. First, many clinical trial press releases are likely
                already included in the LLMs’ pretraining data. While we try to
                reduce this by ‘de-identifying each press release’, and
                providing only the data available to the LLM up to the date of
                the catalyst, there are obviously some uncertainties about
                whether this is sufficient.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve been using this benchmark to test prompting strategies and
                model families. Results so far are mixed but interesting as the
                most reliable approach we found was to use LLMs to quantify
                qualitative features and then a linear regression of these
                features, rather than direct price prediction.
              </p>

                Just wanted to share this with HN. I built a playground link for
                those of you who would like to play around with it in a sandbox.
                Would love to hear some ideas and hope people can play around
                with this!

              <a href="https://www.smooth.sh">https://www.smooth.sh</a>) is a
              browser that agents like Claude Code can use to navigate the web
              reliably, quickly, and affordably. It lets agents specify tasks
              using natural language, hiding UI complexity, and allowing them to
              focus on higher-level intents to carry out complex web tasks. It
              can also use your IP address while running browsers in the cloud,
              which helps a lot with roadblocks like captchas (<a

                Here’s a demo:

              </p>
              <p>
                Agents like Claude Code, etc are amazing but mostly restrained
                to the CLI, while a ton of valuable work needs a browser. This
                is a fundamental limitation to what these agents can do.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far, attempts to add browsers to these agents (Claude’s
                built-in --chrome, Playwright MCP, agent-browser, etc.) all have
                interfaces that are unnatural for browsing. They expose hundreds
                of tools - e.g. click, type, select, etc - and the action space
                is too complex. (For an example, see the low-level details
                listed at
                <a href="https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser"
                  >https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser</a
                >). Also, they don’t handle the billion edge cases of the
                internet like iframes nested in iframes nested in shadow-doms
                and so on. The internet is super messy! Tools that rely on the
                accessibility tree, in particular, unfortunately do not work for
                a lot of websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that these tools are at the wrong level of
                abstraction: they make the agent focus on UI details instead of
                the task to be accomplished.

                Using a giant general-purpose model like Opus to click on
                buttons and fill out forms ends up being slow and expensive. The
                context window gets bogged down with details like clicks and
                keystrokes, and the model has to figure out how to do browser
                navigation each time. A smaller model in a system specifically
                designed for browsing can actually do this much better and at a
                fraction of the cost and latency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Security matters too - probably more than people realize. When
                you run an agent on the web, you should treat it like an
                untrusted actor. It should access the web using a sandboxed
                machine and have minimal permissions by default. Virtual
                browsers are the perfect environment for that. There’s a good
                write up by Paul Kinlan that explains this very well (see
                <a href="https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox"
                  >https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox</a
                >
                and
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46762150"
                  >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46762150</a
                >). Browsers were built to interact with untrusted software
                safely. They’re an isolation boundary that already works.
              </p>
              <p>
                Smooth CLI is a browser designed for agents based on what
                they’re good at. We expose a higher-level interface to let the
                agent think in terms of goals and tasks, not low-level details.
              </p>
              <p>For example, instead of this:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  click(x=342, y=128)
  type("search query")
  click(x=401, y=130)
  scroll(down=500)
  click(x=220, y=340)
  ...50 more steps
</code></pre>
              Your agent just says:
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>  Search for flights from NYC to LA and find the cheapest option
</code></pre>
              Agents like Claude Code can use the Smooth CLI to extract
              hard-to-reach data, fill-in forms, download files, interact with
              dynamic content, handle authentication, vibe-test apps, and a lot
              more.
              <p>
                Smooth enables agents to launch as many browsers and tasks as
                they want, autonomously, and on-demand. If the agent is carrying
                out work on someone’s behalf, the agent’s browser presents
                itself to the web as a device on the user’s network. The need
                for this feature may diminish over time, but for now it’s a
                necessary primitive. To support this, Smooth offers a “self”
                proxy that creates a secure tunnel and routes all browser
                traffic through your machine’s IP address (<a
                  href="https://docs.smooth.sh/features/use-my-ip"
                  >https://docs.smooth.sh/features/use-my-ip</a
                >). This is one of our favorite features because it makes the
                agent look like it’s running on your machine, while keeping all
                the benefits of running in the cloud.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also take away as much security responsibility from the agent
                as possible. The agent should not be aware of authentication
                details or be responsible for handling malicious behavior such
                as prompt injections. While some security responsibility will
                always remain with the agent, the browser should minimize this
                burden as much as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re biased of course, but in our tests, running Claude with
                Smooth CLI has been 20x faster and 5x cheaper than Claude Code
                with the --chrome flag (<a

                any questions about it!
