                I'm Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous,

                monitors how developers interact with your app and automatically
                generates and maintains test coverage nearing 100%. Even for the
                most complex applications. All without needing to write or
                maintain a single test.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our customers find it increases their end-to-end frontend
                development velocity by over 20%. If you’ve ever had the rare
                chance of working on a project where you can have near 100%
                confidence in your changes before you hit merge you’ll
                understand this immediately: programming feels completely
                different in that environment. Every dev can refactor with
                complete confidence and speed. And so they do, keeping the code
                fresh &amp; nimble. Our customers’s developers have been able to
                move faster than they’ve often ever experienced before.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re growing rapidly, and want to provide this experience to
                every software company in the world — while freeing them of the
                burden of writing or maintaining tests. We’ve built a team of
                exclusively world-class software engineers (“One of the
                strongest teams that I have seen” - Jared Friedman, Partner at Y
                Combinator).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you join us we’ll promise you’ll learn faster than you ever
                have in your career, and will be able to fundamentally change
                how the world develops software.
              </p>
              <p>## How does Meticulous work?</p>
              <p>
                You add a script tag on localhost and internal stacks, and
                Meticulous records all the development teams daily interactions
                with the app as they develop features. Meticulous understands
                every line of code, component and route executed by each flow
                and uses this to maintain a visual snapshot test suite that
                covers close to 100% of your code. This suite tests your apps
                UI, user flows and logic at all layers, across all edge cases,
                all branches, all feature flags. As your app evolves, your test
                suite evolves.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tests are executed in an environment that ensures full
                determinism from the lowest level, right down to how the
                browsers’ macro &amp; micro-tasks are scheduled — so no flakes.
                This bedrock of determinism is what makes the full system
                possible.

              <p>## What’s our team like?</p>
              <p>
                We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team
                previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir, GitHub and
                Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at
                these companies. We are backed by some of the best founders and
                technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch
                (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub),
                Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment),
                Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch
                of other incredible folks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an
                entire category of products to build on top of replay. This
                ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance
                impact of frontend code.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to change the way the world develops software, and
                influence software approaches for decades to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding
                engineer to join our team of six. We sponsor visas.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here
                are a few problems you might work on:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of
                sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds. -
                Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains
                determinism. - Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover
                differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that
                are too similar. - Help build out a team of world-class, highly
                collaborative, software engineers.
              </p>
              <p>
                As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build
                the culture and technology from the ground up.
              </p>
              <p>What we look for:</p>
              <p>
                In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with,
                combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We
                also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each
                other; we win as a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level
                skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have
                strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software
                engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code,
                Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc.
                or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value
                transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong
                desire to become the best engineer you can be.

              <a href="https://release.ai/">https://release.ai/</a>). We
              launched on HN in 2020 (<a
                href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22486031"
                >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22486031</a
              >) after leaving TrueCar, where we managed a 300 person
              development team. Our original focus was making staging
              environments easier with ephemeral environments, but along the way
              AI applications started to emerge as an important and critical
              component of distributed applications. As we talked to customers
              using our original product, we realized we had built the
              underlying platform needed to address the needs of orchestrating
              AI applications and infrastructure. So here we are and we’re
              excited to share Release.ai with HN.
              <p>
                Here’s a video showcasing the platform and demonstrating how to
                easily manage new data and changes using the RAG stack of your
                choice:

              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to try release.ai out, we’re offering a sandbox
                account with limited free GPU cycles so you can play around and
                get a feel for Release.ai:
                <a href="https://release.ai">https://release.ai</a>. We suggest
                playing around with some of the RAG AI templates and adding
                custom workflows like in the demo video. The sandbox comes with
                5 free compute hours on an Amazon g5.2xlarge instance (A10 with
                24GB VRAM, 8vCPUs and 32GB). You will also get 16 GB and 4vCPUs
                for cpu workloads such as web servers. You will be able to run
                an inference engine plus things like an api server, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the sandbox expires, you can switch to our free plan,
                which requires a credit card and associating an AWS/GCP account
                with Release to manage the compute in your cloud account. The
                free account provides 100 free managed environment hours a
                month. If you never go over, you never pay us anything. If you
                do, our pricing is here:

                For those that like to read more, here’s the deeper background.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s clear that open source AI and AI privacy are going to be
                big. Yes, many developers are going to choose SaaS offerings
                like OpenAI to build their AI applications, but as open source
                frameworks and models improve, we’re seeing a shift to open
                source running on cloud. Security and privacy is a top concern
                of companies leveraging these SaaS solutions, which forces them
                to look at running infrastructure themselves. That’s where we
                hope to come in: we’ve built Release.ai so all your data, models
                and infrastructure stay in your cloud account and open source
                frameworks are first class citizens.
              </p>
              <p>
                Orchestration - Integrating AI applications into a software
                development workflow and orchestrating their lifecycle is a new
                and different challenge than traditional web application
                development. Release also makes it possible to manage and
                integrate your web and AI apps using a single application and
                methodology.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make orchestrating AI applications easier, we built a
                workflow engine that can create the complex workflows that AI
                applications require. For example, you can automate the
                redeployment of an AI inference server easily when underlying
                data changes using webhooks and our workflow engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cost and expertise - Managing and scaling the hardware required
                to run AI workloads is hard and can be incredibly expensive.
                Release.ai lets you manage GPU compute resources across multiple
                clouds with different instance/node groups for various jobs
                within a single admin interface. We use K8s under the covers to
                pull this off. With over 5 years of building and running K8s
                infrastructure our customers have told us this is how it should
                be done.

                Getting started with AI frameworks is time consuming and
                requires some pretty in-depth expertise. We built out a library
                of AI templates (<a
                  href="https://docs.release.com/release.ai/release.ai-templates"
                  >https://docs.release.com/release.ai/release.ai-templates</a
                >) using our Application Template format (which is kind of a
                super docker-compose:
                <a
                  href="https://docs.release.com/reference-documentation/application-settings/application-template"
                  >https://docs.release.com/reference-documentation/application...</a
                >) for common open source frameworks to make it easy to get
                started developing AI applications. Setting up and getting these
                frameworks running is a hassle, so we made it one click to
                launch and deploy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We currently have over 20 templates including temples for RAG
                applications, fine tuning and useful tools like Juypter
                notebooks, Promptfoo, etc. We worked closely with Docker and
                Nvidia to support their frameworks: GenAI and Nvidia NEMO/Nims.
                We plan to launch community templates soon after launch. If you
                have suggestions for more templates we should support, please
                let us know in the comments.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re thrilled to share Release.ai with you and would love to
                get your feedback. We hope you’ll try it out, and please let us
                know what you think!
