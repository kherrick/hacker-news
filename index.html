                We built a tool to help founders understand how modern
                fundraising (with safes) works, and how much dilution you can
                expect when raising money.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is open-source. The code is a mess right now, but
                it'll get better I promise. You can also help with that.
              </p>
              <p>
                We didn't build this to make money. We genuinely did it because
                we were looking for it, and couldn't find it.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're in fact in the process of fundraising for a company, and
                at first glance the process looks simple. Just an excel sheet
                will do! But then the more we dug into it and tried different
                simulators, the more we realized that it's more complex than it
                looks.
              </p>
              <p>
                We even signed up to Pulley, Carta and others just to run
                simulations. But they're a bit confusing.
              </p>
              <p>
                TL;DR: Understanding modern startup funding and knowing how much
                dilution you'll face is hard. We built a tool that'll hopefully
                help with that. You can add Post-money Safes, priced rounds and
                issue options to employees, and you can see how that affects
                your ownership at every step. You can also simulate an Exit
                scenario and see how much money you'll be left with.
              </p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>Some examples of complex stuff:</p>
              <p>
                - There are many different types of safes. They all convert at
                the first priced round, but in different ways. Some are through
                discount, some are uncapped, some have a fixed valuation cap,
                and some have both a discount and a valuation cap.
              </p>
              <p>
                - All safes (before first priced round) convert at the same
                time. They don't dilute each other, which is what happens in the
                rest of fundraising.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Investors often require you to set aside some options. This
                one is particularily nasty. Basically, if an investor expects
                you to set aside 10% as options, and expects to get 10% equity,
                that's what should appear in the subsequent cap table. However,
                calculating the options is difficult, and is often a circular
                calculation (even Kirsty Nathoo from YC says it's complex and
                avoids showing the calculation in the Safe video "Understanding
                SAFEs and Priced Equity Rounds")
              </p>
              <p>
                - Safes and priced rounds can have pro-rata, but don't always
                exercise it
              </p>
              <p>
                - Pro-ratas of safes are taken from the priced round money, so
                you'd expect the safe holder's equity to remain the same if they
                exercise it. BUT ... it gets diluted by the new options issued.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Safes can have an MFN provision, which defers the valuation
                discussion/calculation until the moment the priced round is
                about to close. With a mix of discounts, uncapped and valuation
                caps, it gets tricky to know which deal is "better".
              </p>
              <p>- ...</p>
              <p>Assumptions and limitations:</p>
              <p>- Only post-money safes and priced rounds.</p>
              <p>
                - No down rounds. There's a bit more complexity around
                liquidation preferences and anti-dilution rights - we don't
                support that now. It only matters if you're simulating a "bad"
                situation. But come on, it's a simulator — Be optimistic.
              </p>
              <p>
                - No pro-rata caps. We might add that soon, to fully support the
                YC standard deal. But for now, if an investor gets a pro-rata,
                they can exercise either all of it (keeping their original
                ownership) or none.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Safes' pro-ratas disappear after the first priced round. (I
                think this is what happens normally?)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Remaining available options get redistributed evenly at exit.
              </p>
              <p>
                - The round is the investor. For the sake of simplicity,
                consider "Series A" as the combination of all series A investors
                into one, super-investor.

                It's different from simple RAG because it searches, classifies,
                and adapts based on relevant papers it uncovers, and then
                continues until it finds every paper on a topic (trying to mimic
                the human research process). Benchmarked 10x higher accuracy and
                total retrieval compared to Google Scholar for a median search
                (whitepaper on website). Also knows when it is complete, and
                misses virtually nothing (&lt; 3% or so, once it's converged).

                teachyourselfmath is a side project that was born out of this
                need. At its core, it is a math PDF extraction engine. The
                engine has some machine learning going on behind the scenes to
                extract math problems in LaTeX from any image or document.

                A little bit about me: I am Vivek, a software engineer based out
                of India with a diverse set of interests including math. This
                project is close to my heart for many different reasons and
                nothing would make me happier than finding people on the
                internet who would find this website to be useful.
              </p>
              <p>I’d love to hear your feedback on this. Thanks!</p>

              <p>
                <i>GOAL</i>: Bernard is an automated links checker that crawls
                your website daily, identifying broken links (internal and
                external), and missing redirects, such as after a redesign or
                URL change.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>TARGET AUDIENCE</i>: Anyone with a website—be it is a
                personal blog or company portal—looking to prevent link rot, to
                keep old URLs reachable and to avoid the dreaded 404 Page Not
                Found error.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>STACK</i>: Elixir, with Phoenix Live View for the interactive
                dashboard. It runs on PostgreSQL, hosted as Podman containers on
                a single dedicated Hetzner server.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>PLAN</i>: I am releasing this as a free, open beta to address
                the last few issues, and hope to introduce paid plans in
                February 2024. While there is a backlog of improvements and bug
                fixes, my primary focus now is making sure the product is
                aligned with what users need.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pricing model is yet to be defined, but I'm considering a
                free tier for small website owners, and a usage-based plan
                starting from $10/mo for X,000 links checked per month. This
                would pair well with the upcoming REST API to provide a
                links-checker-as-a-service product to embed in third-party
                systems. (Feel free to contact me if you might be interested in
                using this API)
              </p>
              <p>
                I also wrote about my journey to get this off the ground, and
                the challenges I faced at
