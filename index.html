                I've created a web-based editor for ASCII file directory trees
                called asciitreeman. It's designed to make it easier to edit and
                reorganize the output of the tree command.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can try it out here:
                <a href="https://reorx.github.io/asciitreeman/"
                  >https://reorx.github.io/asciitreeman/</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                And the source code is on GitHub:
                <a href="https://github.com/reorx/asciitreeman"
                  >https://github.com/reorx/asciitreeman</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the key features include visual tree editing with
                drag-and-drop-like operations, real-time sync where changes are
                immediately reflected in the ASCII output, keyboard shortcuts
                for navigation (J/K or arrow keys), and auto-saving your work to
                local storage.
              </p>
              <p>
                What's interesting is that I used Claude Code to "vibe-code"
                this project in a very short amount of time. It was a fun
                experiment in AI-assisted development. For those curious about
                the process, I've included the prompts and specifications I used
                in the source code. You can check them out in the spec.md and
                CLAUDE.md files in the repository.
              </p>
              <p>Hop you find it useful!</p>

              <p>What it does:</p>
              <p>
                * View `.docx` files directly in your terminal with (mostly)
                proper formatting
              </p>
              <p>* Tables actually look like tables (with Unicode borders!)</p>
              <p>* Nested lists work correctly with indentation</p>
              <p>* Full-text search with highlighting</p>
              <p>* Copy content straight to clipboard with `c`</p>
              <p>* Export to markdown/CSV/JSON</p>
              <p>Why I made this:</p>
              <p>
                Working on servers over SSH, I constantly hit Word docs I needed
                to check quickly. The existing solutions I'm aware of either
                strip all formatting (docx2txt) or require GUI apps. Wanted
                something that felt as polished as [glow](<a
                  href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow"
                  >https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow</a
                >) but for Word documents.
              </p>
              <p>The good stuff:</p>
              <p>* 50ms startup vs Word's 8+ seconds</p>
              <p>* Works over SSH (obviously)</p>
              <p>* Preserves document structure and formatting</p>
              <p>* Smart table alignment based on data types</p>
              <p>* Interactive outline view for long docs</p>
              <p>
                Built with Rust + ratatui and heavily inspired by Charm's
                [glow](<a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow"
                  >https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow</a
                >) package for viewing Markdown in the CLI (built in Go)!
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>    # Install
    cargo install --git https://github.com/bgreenwell/doxx
    
    # Use
    doxx quarterly-report.docx
</code></pre>
              Still early but handles most Word docs I throw at it. Always
              wanted a proper Word viewer in my terminal toolkit alongside
              `bat`, `glow`, and friends. Let me know what you think!

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                The problem I had was simple: I wanted a low-tech way to type
                styled text, but I didn't want to load a complex 500KB library,
                especially if I was going to initialize it dozens of times on
                the same page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Markdown in a plain &lt;textarea&gt; was the best alternative to
                a full WYSIWYG, but its main drawback is how ugly it looks
                without any formatting. I can handle it, but my clients
                certainly can't.
              </p>
              <p>
                I went down the ContentEditable rabbit hole for a few years, but
                always came to realize others had solved it better than I ever
                could.
              </p>
              <p>
                I kept coming back to this problem: why can't I have a simple,
                performant, beautiful markdown editor? The best solution I ever
                saw was Ghost's split-screen editor: markdown on the left,
                preview on the right, with synchronized scrolling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, about a year ago, an idea popped into my head: what if we
                layered a preview pane behind a &lt;textarea&gt;? If we aligned
                them perfectly, then even though you were only editing plain
                text, it would look and feel like you were editing rich text!
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, there would be downsides: you'd have to use a
                monospace font, all content would have to have the same font
                size, and all the markdown markup would have to be displayed in
                the final preview.
              </p>
              <p>But those were tradeoffs I could live with.</p>
              <p>
                Anyways, version 1 didn't go so well... it turns out it's harder
                to keep a textarea and a rendered preview in alignment than I
                thought. Here's what I discovered:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Lists were hard to align - bullet points threw off character
                alignment. Solved with HTML entities (• for bullets) that
                maintain monospace width
              </p>
              <p>
                - Not all monospace fonts are truly monospace - bold and italic
                text can have different widths even in "monospace" fonts,
                breaking the perfect overlay
              </p>
              <p>
                - Embedding was a nightmare - any inherited CSS from parent
                pages (margin, padding, line-height) would shift alignment. Even
                a 1px shift completely broke the illusion
              </p>
              <p>The solution was obsessive normalization:</p>
              <p></p>
              <pre><code>    // The entire trick: a transparent textarea over a preview div
    layerElements(textarea, preview)
    applyIdenticalSpacing(textarea, preview)

    // Make textarea invisible but keep the cursor
    textarea.style.background = 'transparent'
    textarea.style.color = 'transparent'
    textarea.style.caretColor = 'black'

    // Keep them in sync
    textarea.addEventListener('input', () =&gt; {
      preview.innerHTML = parseMarkdown(textarea.value)
      syncScroll(textarea, preview)
    })
</code></pre>
              A week ago I started playing with version 2 and discovered
              GitHub's &lt;markdown-toolbar&gt; element, which handles markdown
              formatting in a plain &lt;textarea&gt; really well.
              <p>
                That experiment turned into OverType (<a
                  href="https://overtype.dev"
                  >https://overtype.dev</a
                >), which I'm showing to you today -- it's a rich markdown
                editor that's really just a &lt;textarea&gt;. The key insight
                was that once you solve the alignment challenges, you get
                everything native textareas provide for free: undo/redo, mobile
                keyboard, accessibility, and native performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far it works surprisingly well across browsers and mobile. I
                get performant rich text editing in one small package (45KB
                total). It's kind of a dumb idea, but it works! I'm planning to
                use it in all my projects and I'd like to keep it simple and
                minimal.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would love it if you would kick the tires and let me know what
                you think of it. Happy editing!

                More and more sites (especially adult ones) are now forcing
                users to upload IDs or selfies to continue. We think that’s a
                terrible idea: handing over government documents to random sites
                is a huge privacy risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                This new setting workarounds those verification flows via DNS
                tricks. It’s available today to all users, including free
                accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re curious how the HN community feels about this. Is it the
                right way to protect privacy online, or will it just provoke
                regulators to push harder?
