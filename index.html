            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I'm developing a map-based event discovery platform that helps
                people find unique and exciting events in their city or area. I
                imagine that it could help young locals who are searching what
                is to be attended in their area &amp; tourists who are visiting
                and want to find what to do in the area.
              </p>
              <p>But before I unleash it on the world, I need your help!</p>
              <p>
                One major pain point that I am trying to solve is information
                overload and difficulty in discovering relevant events nearby.
                Traditionally, people might rely on social media, local
                newspapers, or word-of-mouth to find events happening around
                them.
              </p>
              <p>These methods can be:</p>
              <p>
                Scattered: Information is spread across different sources,
                making it time-consuming to search. Unfiltered: Showing a large
                amount of events, not necessarily relevant to individual
                interests. Limited information: Often lacking key details like
                event descriptions, schedules, or ticket options.
              </p>
              <p>So my MVP address these issues by:</p>
              <p>
                Aggregating: Bringing together event information from multiple
                sources in one place. Personalization: Using filters and user
                preferences to recommend relevant events. Visualization:
                Displaying events on a map, allowing users to discover events
                based on location and proximity. Detailed information: Providing
                comprehensive descriptions and links to purchase tickets.
              </p>
              <p>
                What other features I plan to build: Build-in resell
                marketplace, own event upload, live-streaming, PPV and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                However I find it difficult to get any feedback on the platform.
                I've tried paid ads, posting to other Early Adopters websites,
                personally reaching out to people, who I think are target users,
                but do not get any meaningful feedback.
              </p>
              <p>So I'm eager to hear your honest opinions:</p>
              <p>What works well in the platform?</p>
              <p>What needs improvement?</p>
              <p>Are there any features you'd like to see added?</p>
              <p>
                Your feedback will be invaluable in shaping the future of Wiwo!
              </p>
              <p>
                P.S. For now only US users are needed, as other won't find
                events in their areas :)

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                In January I launched an indexing tool called Index Rusher, that
                forces google to index your pages quicker, to get ranked for SEO
                faster. This whole project was something I needed myself since I
                got over 20 products and paying for an external one would simply
                cost too much.
              </p>
              <p>
                My initial idea was that I would just build an internal tool for
                my use, that has only 1 feature. No UI really, just 1 button.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the middle of the process, I realized that I could actually
                run an experiment and launch this tool publically with just one
                feature. Super simple.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hired a dev who spent a month building it. It looked super
                easy at first, but it turned out there were so many hidden
                snakes on the way. Troubles with sitemaps, google APIs, and
                more.
              </p>
              <p>
                1 month later I launched it (In Jan). The launch didn't go so
                great, but I didn't really have high hopes. Because nobody knew
                about this tool, I had no traffic on the site. I still sold
                several licenses, which made me pretty happy, it felt like
                validation, people needed it, even if it solved such a narrow
                problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                At that point, I declared my next stage of the experiment:
                Growing the traffic and revenue.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've done a number of growth hacks in the next 30 days,
                resulting in over $7k in revenue, but what's more important, the
                traffic on the site has grown a lot and stays high and growing.
                This means I've done a pretty good job on organic growth too,
                which will just accelerate over time.
              </p>
              <p>Here is what I've done:</p>
              <p>
                Cross-linking. I added links in the footer on my other products.
                This is one hidden effect of having multiple products. Each may
                serve as a lead magnet for the other one. In my case, I have the
                same audience for all my tools, people who love one of my tools
                often check out the rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being visible on social media. I monitor discussions around the
                Google Indexing topics and add my replies there. I don't just
                spam in replies with my tools, in most cases, I genuinely answer
                and bring value. If my reply gets a reply, I may include my URL
                in the next reply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Social Media and Blog posts. I've posted several posts about
                Growth, where I mentioned Indexrusher since I actually use it
                for me Growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traffic from Directories. This one was the top channel of
                growth. Over 50% of the paying users arrive from web
                directories. I used a tool that listed Index Rusher on 100
                directories &amp; websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sponsored listings. I "sponsored" directories to place a banner
                for my tool on the top of their page/list. Seeing the effect of
                "boosted" listings. The ROI was good. About $2.5k of revenue
                came in from these boosts.
              </p>

                Affiliate partners Made a deal with a few affiliate partners who
                reached out to me on X and he drove a decent amount of traffic
                and paid users to me since he was launching on PH the same week,
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                My next steps will be 1) Promote it to 100,000+ users of my
                Website Builder and reach out to more website builders and pitch
                them the integration
              </p>
              <p>2) Increase Word-of-mouth effect</p>
              <p>3) Perhaps try some paid ads</p>
              <p>
                4) Add automated emails to remind about Index Rusher users who
                signed up but didn't buy
              </p>
              <p>5) Launch a directory as a lead magnet</p>
              <p>6) Launch little free tools as lead magnets</p>
              <p>7) Product Hunt launch</p>
              <p>8) AppSumo launch</p>
              <p>I will make a new post in a month describing how it went.</p>

              the Apple ecosystem, so I quickly hacked this together. I tend to
              use Notes as a scratchpad for prompts, so it's nice to do some
              quick inference without leaving the app.
              <p>
                Notes doesn't really support plugins so I'm using the macOS
                accessibility API for reading selections and then stream
                responses using the clipboard (not ideal but it works).

              >). We are building a conversational speech engine to help
              developers build natural-sounding voice AI. Our API abstracts away
              the complexities of AI voice conversations, so you can make your
              voice application the best at what it does. Here's a demo video:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LT64_mgkro"
                >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LT64_mgkro</a
              >.
              <p>
                With the advent of LLMs and recent breakthroughs in speech
                synthesis, conversational voice AI has just gotten good enough
                to create really exciting use cases. However, developers often
                underestimate what's required to build a good and
                natural-sounding conversational voice AI. Many simply stitch
                together ASR (speech-to-text), an LLM, and TTS (text-to-speech),
                and expect to get a great experience. It turns out it's not that
                simple.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's more going on in conversation than we consciously
                realize: things like knowing when to speak and when to listen,
                handling interruptions, 0-200 ms latency and backchanneling
                phrases (e.g., "yeah", "uh huh") to signal that they are
                listening. These are natural for humans, but hard for AI to get
                right. Developers spend hundreds of hours on the AI conversation
                experience but end up with poor experiences like 4-5s long
                latencies, inappropriate cutoffs, speaking over each other, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, we built Retell AI. We have followed the overall paradigm of
                having speech-to-text, LLM, and text-to-speech components, but
                have added additional conversation models in between to
                orchestrate the conversation while allowing maximum
                configurability for the developers in each step. You can think
                of our models as adding a “domain expert” layer for the dynamics
                of conversation itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Retell is designed for you to bring your own LLM into our
                pipeline. Currently, we can achieve 800ms end-to-end latency,
                handle interruptions, speech isolation, with tons of
                customization options (e.g., speaking rate, voice temperature,
                add ambient sound). We created a guest account for HN, so you
                can try our playground with a 10-min free trial without login:

              </p>
              <p>
                Our main product is a developer-facing API, but you can try it
                without writing code (e.g. create agents, connect to a phone
                number) via our dashboard. If you want to test it in production,
                feel free to also self-serve with our API documentation. One of
                our customers just launched, and you can view their demo:
