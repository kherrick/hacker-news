              <a href="https://humanlayer.dev">https://humanlayer.dev</a>), an
              API that lets AI agents contact humans for feedback, input, and
              approvals. We enable safe deployment of autonomous/headless AI
              systems in production. You can try it with our Python or
              TypeScript SDKs and start using it immediately with a free trial.
              We have a free tier and transparent usage-based pricing. Here’s a
              demo:

              <p>
                What's really exciting is that we're enabling teams to deploy AI
                systems that would otherwise be too risky. We let you focus on
                building powerful agents while knowing that critical steps will
                <i>always</i> get a human-in-the-loop. It's been dope seeing
                people start to think bigger when they consider dynamic human
                oversight as a key ingredient in production AI systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                This started when we were building AI agents for data teams. We
                wanted to automate tedious tasks like dropping unused tables,
                but customers were (rightfully!) opposed to giving AI agents
                direct access to production systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting AI to "production grade" reliability is a function of
                "how risky is this task the AI is performing". We didn't have
                the 3+ months it would have taken to sink into evals, fine
                tuning, and prompt engineering to get to a point where the agent
                had 99.9+% reliability—and even then, getting decision makers
                comfortable with flipping the switch on was a challenge. So
                instead we built some basic approval flows, like "ask in Slack
                before dropping tables".
              </p>
              <p>
                But this communication itself needed guardrails—what if the
                agent contacted the wrong person? How would the head of data
                look if a tool he bought sent a nagging Slack message to the
                CEO? Our buyers wanted the agent to ask stakeholders for
                approval, but first <i>they</i> wanted to approve the "ask for
                approval" action itself. And then I started thinking about it...
                as a product builder + owner, <i>I</i> wanted to approve the
                "ask for approval to ask for approval" action!
              </p>
              <p>
                I hacked together a human-AI interaction that would handle each
                of these cases across both my and my customers' Slack instances.
                By this time, I was convinced that any team building AI agents
                would need this kind of infrastructure and decided to build it
                as a standalone product. I presented the MVP at an AI meetup in
                SF and had a ton of incredible conversations, and went all in on
                building HumanLayer.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you integrate the HumanLayer SDK, your AI agent can request
                human approval at any point in its execution. We handle all the
                complexity of routing these requests to the right people through
                their preferred channels (Slack or email, SMS and Teams coming
                soon), managing state while waiting for responses, and providing
                a complete audit trail. In addition to "ask for approval", we
                also support a more generic "human as tool" function that can be
                exposed to an LLM or agent framework, and will handle collecting
                a human response to a generic question like "I'm stuck on
                $PROBLEM, I've tried $THINGS, please advise" (I get messages
                like this sometimes from in-house agents we rolled out for
                back-office automations).
              </p>
              <p>
                Because it's at the tool-calling layer, HumanLayer's SDK works
                with any AI framework like CrewAI, LangChain, etc, and any
                language model that supports tool calling. If you're rolling
                your own agentic/tools loop, you can use lower level SDK
                primitives to manage approvals however you want. We're even
                exploring use cases where HumanLayer is used for human-to-human
                approval, not just AI-to-human.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're already seeing HumanLayer used in some cool ways. One
                customer built an AI SDR that drafts personalized sales emails
                but asks for human approval in Slack before sending anything to
                prospects. Another uses it to power an AI newsletter where
                subscribers can have email conversations with the content.
                HumanLayer handles receiving inbound emails and routing them to
                agents that can respond, and giving those agents tools to do so.
                One team uses HumanLayer to build a customer-facing DevOps
                agent—their AI agent reviews PRs, plans and executes db
                migrations, all while getting human sign-off at critical steps
                and reaching out to the team for steering if it encounters any
                issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a free tier and flexible credits-based pricing. For
                teams building customer-facing agents, you get whitelabeling and
                additional features and priority support.

                However, Liquid is a terrible language for data-mangling, and
                simple filtering/sorting/merging can become very annoying. So I
                wrote a Jekyll SQLite plugin that lets you use the same data
                interface in Jekyll/Liquid, but backed by a SQLite file(s).
              </p>
              <p>
                It gives you the simplicity of the Baked Data pattern[2], and
                the flexibility of using SQL for data-wrangling, within a static
                site generator.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a demo, I took the northwind dataset, and generated a site[3]
                with a few sample queries[4]. It demos both site-level, and
                page-level queries alongside data-pages generator to generate a
                page for every product/category/customer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've been using this across a few sites in production for almost
                a year, looking for feedback on usage semantics and feature
                suggestions.
