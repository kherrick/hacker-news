              <p>
                2. Kill your EGO. It's not about me, but the user. I must want
                what the user wants, not what I want.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Don't chaise investors, chase users, and then investors will
                be chasing you.
              </p>
              <p>4. Never hire managers. Only hire doers until PMF.</p>
              <p>5. Landing page is the least important thing in a startup.</p>
              <p>
                6. Hire only fullstack devs. There is nothing less productive in
                this world than a team of developers.
              </p>
              <p>
                7. Chase global market from day 1. You'll win or fail despite
                the market you target in most cases, so go for bigger upside.
              </p>
              <p>
                8. Do SEO from day 2. As early as you can. I ignored this for 14
                years. It's my biggest regret.
              </p>
              <p>
                9. Sell features, before building them. Ask existing users if
                they want this feature. I run DMs with 10-20 users every day,
                where I chat about all my ideas and features I wanna add.
              </p>
              <p>
                10. Hire only people you would wanna hug. My mentor said this to
                me in 2015. And it was a big shift. I realized that if I don't
                wanna hug the person, it means I dislike them. Even if I can't
                say why, but that's the fact. Sooner or later, we would have a
                conflict and eventually break up.
              </p>
              <p>
                11. Invest all money into your startups and friends. Not crypt0,
                not stockmarket, not properties. I did some math, if I kept
                investing all my money into all my friends’ startups, that would
                be about 70 investments. 3 of them turned into unicorns
                eventually. Since 2022, I have invested all my money into my
                products, friends, and network.
              </p>
              <p>
                12. Post on Twitter daily. I started posting here in March this
                year. It's my primary source of new connections and traffic.
              </p>
              <p>
                13. Don't work/partner with corporates. Corporations always seem
                like an amazing opportunity. They're big and rich, they promise
                huge stuff, millions of users, etc. But every single time none
                of this happens. Because you talk to a regular employees there.
                They waste your time, destroy focus, shift priorities.
              </p>
              <p>
                14. Don't get ever distracted by hype, e.g. crypt0. I lost 1.5
                years of my life this way. I met the worst people along the way.
                Fricks, scammers, thieves. Some of my close friends turned into
                thieves along the way, just because it was so common in that
                space.
              </p>
              <p>
                15. Don't build consumer apps. Only b2b. Consumer apps are so
                hard, like a lottery. It's just 0.00001% who make it big. The
                rest don't. Even if I got many users, then there is a
                monetization challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                16. Don't hold on bad project for too long, max 1 year. Some
                projects just don't work. In most cases, it's either the idea
                that's so wrong that you can't even pivot it or it's a team that
                is good one by one but can't make it as a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                17. Tech conferences are a waste of time. They cost money, take
                energy, and time and you never really meet anyone there. Most
                people there are the "good" employees of corporations who were
                sent there as a perk for being loyal to the corporation.
              </p>
              <p>
                18. Scrum is a Scam. If I had a team that had to be nagged every
                morning with questions as if they were children in kindergarten,
                then things would eventually fail. The only good stuff I managed
                to do happened with people who were grownups and could manage
                their stuff. We would just do everything over chat as a sync on
                goals and plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                19. Outsource nothing at all until PMF. In a startup, almost
                everything needs to be done in a slightly different way, more
                creative, and more integrated into the vision. When outsourcing,
                the external members get no love and no case for the product.
                It's just yet another assignment in their boring job.
              </p>
              <p>
                20. Bootstrap. I spent way too much time raising money. I raised
                more than 10 times, preseed, seed, and series A. But each time
                it was a 3-9 month project, meetings every week, and lots of
                destruction. I could afford to bootstrap, but I still went the
                VC-funded way, I don't know why. To be honest, I didn't know
                bootstrapping was a thing I could do or anyone does.
              </p>
              <p>That's it.</p>

              <p>
                Storyteller is a self-hosted platform for ebooks with synced
                narration. This is basically self-hosted WhisperSync, for anyone
                familiar with that Amazon product.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's currently made up of two self-hostable backend systems and
                a mobile app for reading and listening to the books it produces.
                Technically it uses an open spec, EPUB 3's "Media Overlay", for
                syncing the narration, but very few ebook apps actually support
                Media Overlays, and even fewer work well and have nice
                interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mobile app is available on the Apple App Store as
                "Storyteller Reader", and I plan to release it for Android as
                well early next year.
              </p>
              <p>Anyway, I hope someone finds this interesting or useful!</p>
